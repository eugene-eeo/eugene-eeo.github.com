<h2>Welcome to mon maison!</h2>
<p>
Welcome to this site, also known to a very few people (specifically, myself), as the backdoor of my mind and a place to post whatever I fancy- including seemingly unrelated and random topics. Some are quite meaningful, while others are quite stupid and rather uncharted. Whatever it is, I hope you enjoy reading through what I have to offer to the Internet. <i><b>Note:</b> Some of the documents are finished, while others aren't.</i>
</p>
<p>
I am mainly a Python programmer, though I did learn a little handful of stuff like C++, C, Rust (fairly new), Perl (never again) and JavaScript. Being used to Python's syntax, I've never quite understood why the complexity must be inbound with C-like languages, including Rust.
