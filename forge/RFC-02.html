	<h1>considerations for plugins</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		As Forge will continue to grow, there would, at a certain point in time, come a need for plugins, or job-specific executables which can be preconfigured prior to running, see <a href="http://gruntjs.com/plugins">gruntjs.com/plugins</a> for such examples.
	<p>
		There are several ways in which these can be implemented- firstly, they can be stored in some <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> repo and then downloaded when needed, ran, and then deleted. This would bring about multiple issues like unstable builds, bandwidth issues, etc.
	<p>
		Secondly, plugins can be stored in either the user's home folder, which would now depend on the <code>os.getenv(<span id="string">"HOME"</span>)</code> output, or a "lower-level" folder like <code>/usr/local/</code>.
	<div id="tabbed">
	<h2>invocation methods</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		There are also multiple ways in which the plugins can be invoked- the command-line method or the config-file method. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.
	<p>
		The command-line method involves the invocation of the plugin's main executable(s) using command-line options which would, presumably, be parsed by the executable itself.
	<p>
		An alternative method might be to create a static configuration file inside a folder like <code>/usr/local/forge/config/</code>, which would presumably be parsed by the plugin's executable, and then invoke the executable.
	</div>
	<p>
		With my current coding skills and forge's relatively new age, it seems best that we would go for a static configuration-file based invocation, and a directory for storing plugins- <code>/usr/local/</code> would seem the rational way to go.
