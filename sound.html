	<h2>The Basic Components of Sound</h2>

	<p>
		Sound is, from a Physicist's viewpoint, the vibration of particles within a material (which in theory, could be anything other than a vacuum). Sound is something that happens as a result of reactions between everyday objects, a.k.a. a way of transferring often excessive amounts of energy- similar to light energy; since energy cannot be lost, neither can it be created. Sound is caused by the differences in pressue within a given material, i.e. increase and decrease in the "closeness" in which the particles are packed together, known as condensations are rarefactions- we will come to that later on. Sound is usually expressed as a wave, since (but not only because) it can be drawn easily and several models can be built around it.
	<p>

		Basically, the production of sound is made possible by two important basic "actions" which can be performed towards the particles within the material- expansion and compression, otherwise known as rarefactions and condensations, respectively. They are what causes sound and other waves to inherit the wave function, since a wave diagram effectively illustrates a compression and a rarefaction caused by sound and other waves. Both cause a decrease and an increase in pressure respectively, and would then lead to oscillations which are then received by our ears and then interpreted as a specific "tune" by our brains.
	<p>
		Sound can travel through anything but a vacuum, and would travel faster in materials which are packed together more tightly (<i>aka have stronger inter-molecular force</i>), because as the particles are closer together, vibrations would occur much faster and more easily as a result of the short distances. Less energy is also lost as a result. We can therefore conclude that <i>the speed of sound increases as the density of a material increases.</i> Speed in sound is also similar to <i>S = D/t</i>, however, it's correctly expressed as
		<a name="speed"><dd></a>
			<i>v = &fnof;&lambda;</i>
		</dd>
	<p>
		Where &lambda; is the wavelength and &fnof; is the frequency. These will be covered later on. <b>Note:</b> For sound to be produced, it is not the <i>entire</i> medium that is vibrating back and forth at the same time; rather, it's the individual molecules of the substance that are vibrating. And as they do, each molecule hits another and returns to it's original position.
	<p>
		The properties of a sound wave include amplitude, period, pitch, wavelength, and frequency:
		<ul>
			<li>Amplitude is the height of a waveform peak (either from a condensation to the zero line, or the rarefaction to the zero line), which determines the loudness of a sound wave, for example, a louder sound would have a higher amplitude. Amplitude is usually measured in decibels, or dB.</li>
			<li>Frequency is the number of condensations and rarefactions that occur through a specific point in one second. It is measured in Hertz. The formula for frequency is <i>&fnof; = 1/t</i>. In other words, frequency is inversely proportional to time.</li>
			<li>Pitch is the "highness" of a sound, which is determined by it's frequency. It is also measured in Hertz.</li>
			<li>Period refers to the time between successive waveform peaks, and where it is measured, it can be referred to as a lattice (where one point is exactly identical to the next in terms of position).</li>
			<li>Wavelength is the distance traveled in one cycle per second, usually measured in meters. It can be found using the <i>&lambda; = c/&fnof; </i> formula, which is sourced from the <a href="#speed">speed</a> formula.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		As with any other energies, there are several sound-based "phenomenas", some which are listed in the following paragraphs. The knowledge of these can only be made possible if the reader has a basic idea of the basic concepts of sound.
	<p>
		<b>The Doppler Shift</b><br/>
		When the sound source is moving, the frequency of the measured sound will be altered. This is known as the Doppler Shift. Approaching sounds are higher in frequency (you can think that they are "<i>squashing</i>" particles), and receding sounds are lower in frequency. This explains why the sound produced from a police siren will vary in pitch and wavelength (provided that the <i>velocity</i> is constant) will alter during different intervals of time. The formula for finding the varying frequency is:
		<dd>
			<i>&fnof;<sup>o</sup> = &fnof; [ v / ( v &plusmn; v<sup>s</sup> ) ]</i>
		</dd>
	<p>
		Where <i>&fnof;<sup>o</sup></i> is the frequency heard by the observer, <i>&fnof;</i> is the frequency of the sound source, <i>v</i> is the speed of sound in air, and <i>v<sup>s</sup></i> is the speed of the (moving) source.

		<b>Interference</b><br/>
		Sound waves, similar to exponentials, will combine additively. When sounds are in phase, they increase the amplitude- this is known as positive interference. When sounds are completely out of phase, they cancel each other out, known as negative interference. Sounds partially out of phase will combine to create varying amplitudes at different points, known as beats. They are effectively shown in the diagram to the left. They are also referred to as acoustical interference.

		<b>Spherical Spreading</b><br/>
		The loss in in sound intensity follows the inverse square law, and pressure drops in half for every doubling of distance. The inverse square law, which is a quite popular one, basically means that the intensity is inversely proportional to distance squared, i.e. <i>i = 1/d<sup>2</sup></i>.
		<p>
			It is also useful to imagine the propagation of sound waves as a sphere-like object, in which the intensity at the surface of the sphere drops as the surface is measured further away from the center of the sphere. For example, consider this series of plots to place on a graph, where <i>x</i> is the distance from the center and <i>y</i> is the result. You would end up with something like (1, 1) (2, 1/4) (3, 1/9).
	<p>
		<b>Acoustical Impedance</b><br/>
		Acoustical Impedance is the term given to the degree in which a medium is compressible by sound pressure. It dictates the efficiency of sound production and reception by organisms when sound is refracted through that certain medium. Transmission between media with different impedances is difficult.
		<p>
			The formula for finding the acoustical impedance is as shown below:
			<dd>
				<i>Acoustical Impedance = c * Density of Medium</i>
			</dd>

		<b>Reflection and Refraction</b><br/>
		If medium 1, the medium in which the sound wave is traveling through and hits the boundary between another medium, is less dense than medium 2, most of the energy in the wave would be reflected from the boundary between media. If the incidence angle exceeds the critical angle, some energy will be refracted into Media 2 with a reduced angle.
		<p>
			However, if media 2 is less dense than media 1, the energy refracted into Media 2 will have an increased angle. Whether the wave would reflect depends on the size of the object of media 2. This is also similar to the refraction phenomena observed with light rays.
	<p>
		<b>Scattering</b>
		<br/>
		Scattering is a phenomena which a single ray is divided into multiple rays with lesser energy. In the case of sound, however, this depends on the ratio of the wavelength and the reflecting object.
		<ul>
			<li>Rayleigh Scattering occurs when the ratio of the wavelength is larger than the object, i.e. 5:1. The sound would be scattered in all directions as a result.</li>
			<li>Diffractive Scattering happens when the ratio of the wavelength and the object is identical, i.e. 4:4, and as a result, would produce both a reflected and diffracted wave. During Diffractive Scattering:
				<ul>
					<li>Part of the sound wave is diffracted around the object, known as the creeping wave component.</li>
					<li>The reflected wave is out of phase with the creeping wave, and may cause (complete) negative interference.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Simple Scattering occurs when the object is larger than the wavelength, which would result in a single, reflected wave.</li>
		</ul>
