	Crystals, in their simplest form, are orderly arrangements of <i>pure</i> or substances- for example diamond is pure carbon which is arranged differently, and quartz is pure silicon dioxide (which allows us to conclude that the formation crystals do not require the substance itself to be an atom or a molecule). Crystals form as their particles move closer and closer together, typically because of pressure and a decrease in temperature, or as a solvent evaporates. Once molecules begin to associate, their geometry and checmical activity would determine the shape of the crystals that would form, which in general is determined by the amount of the substance present, and how quickly the atoms can associate. The slower the association, the larger the crystal.
<p>
	As water evaporates from the internal spaces of the stones, crystal structures like geodes and hydrolites would form. However, most crystals have a volcanic origin- which can be found both in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rock is formed when the magma cools (both outside and inside the crust/mantle) and different substances would then be crystallized. Sometimes very large crystals can be found when magma cools slowly below the surface of the Earth. Igneous rocks generally contain huge crystals because they are not <i>really</i> affected by the temperature from below, giving them time to cool down.

	Crystals are also formed when land masses move (known as the movement of tectonic plates), which is typically what happens to form metamorphic rocks. The crust of the Earth buckles and folds, raising mountains and creating new cavities, which in turn alter the pressure and temperature- exposed sections would theoretically cool down via air convection or water. These create great pressures or temperatures that would change the crystal structures in rocks. Crystals in these rocks are generally pretty small, given the proven theory that cooler substances posses a greater density than that of a <i>hotter</i> substance, which means that the cycle would keep going around in a metamorphic rock- from crystal back into normal formation.
