				The XMLRPC Node is a simple (made of three scripts) and robust implementation of both the <a href="http://www.returninfinity.com/baremetalnode.html">BareMetal Node</a> concept and meant as a protocol for anyone's dreams of implementing their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster">Beowulf Cluster</a>.
				<p>
				In short, Node is an XMLRPC protocol based "framework" for you to deploy commands, or tasks upon. Fortunately, Node does not have a massive API with complex commands- it's a relatively small and lightweight script designed to be as realistic and user-friendly as possible.
				<p>
				You can download the source from the following links:
				<ul>
					<a href="node.py">Node Server</a> | <a href="control.py">Controller + Interface</a> | <a href="slave.py">Worker Node</a>
				</ul>
				<p>
				<b>Note:</b> before you deploy your own cluster and perform whatever you want with it (i.e. pranks are a good idea) it's recommended that you actually read <a href="../node-plans.html">RFC01</a> for a basic overview of the Node concept and what it actually is. <i>Documentation is currently via the developer's understanding of the comments placed inside the code.</i>

				The <a href="https://github.com/eugene-eeo/eugene-eeo.github.com/commit/5c9ee34d15a98b2a1f41dbe5a48357cde068c539"><code>5c9ee34</code></a> commit will see several changes to the code, notably the messages system and a few "hotfixes" to termination of the worker nodes, which was albeit clumsy at first. Problems with process management may be fixed in the next build. Failure mechanisms might be considered. <p align="right" style="margin-top:0;"> - Mon Apr 15 08:58:29 2013

				The first intensive tests have been ran on a makeshift cluster system of mine (a Unix machine and a MS Windows7 machine, followed by an old MS WindowsXP machine) running on the latest version of XMLRPC Node. Everything seems to work fine- though I still have to find a way to let them communicate through ethernet. More tests will undoubtedly be made. <p align="right" style="margin-top:0;"> - Fri Apr 12 08:24:34 2013

				I have managed to develop a tiny automatic Node scaling application, but it remains primitive. See <a href="scale.py">scale.py</a> for more information. I would also set up a git repository if there's a need for that.<p align="right" style="margin-top: 0;"> - Thu Apr 11 12:50:19 2013
