  <title>Math Behind 2048</title>

  <h1>Math Behind 2048</h1>
  <p class='begin'>
  2048 is a deceptively simple game where one tries to get the
  2048 tile. Let's refer to the process of joining two tiles of
  value \(x\) and creating a new tile \(2x\) as combining. The aim
  in this document is to describe the maths behind calculating the
  minimum number of combinations required to creating a 2048
  tile. We'll begin with a few assumptions:

  <ul>
    <li>At each turn, only tiles of value 2 will be generated.</li>
    <li>The player will <i>not</i> make any mistakes and is 100%
        efficient in terms of tiles &mdash; that is, said player
        will fully utilise each and every tile.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Let's begin by visualizing how many tiles and combinations are
  required to make a fairly low value; let's say 16.

  <div class='margin'>
    <img src='graph.png' width='100%'/>
  </div>

  <p>
  We can quickly see that 16 requires a combination of 2 tiles
  of value 8, which both require a total of 2 combinations of
  tiles of value 4, which in turn requires a total of 4 combinations
  of 8 tiles of value 2.

  <p>
  Let's generalize this and say that for any value of \(n\),
  where \( 2^{n} = x \), we can write the minimum combinations
  required function:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  f(n) &amp;= 2f(n-1) + 1 \\
  f(1) &amp;= 0
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <p>
  This should be intuitive because for each tile of higher power
  \(2^n\) (e.g. 8), we need the total combinations to make 2 tiles
  of \(2^{n-1}\) (i.e. 4), followed by one more combination to
  combine the two smaller tiles. \(f(1) = 0\) because no moves
  are required to get a tile of value \(2^1\).

  <p>
  We can now calculate the total number of combinations
  required to make the 2048 tile. First we have to
  find the \(n\) such that \(2^n = 2048\) &mdash; fortunately that
  is easy enough:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  n &amp; = \log_{2}{x} \\
    &amp; = \log_{2}{2048} = 11
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <p>
  Here comes the calculations:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  f(2) &amp;= 2f(1) + 1 = 1 \\
  f(3) &amp;= 2f(2) + 1 = 3 \\
  f(4) &amp;= 2f(3) + 1 = 7 \\
  f(5) &amp;= 2f(4) + 1 = 15 \\
  &amp;\ldots\\
  f(11) &amp;= 1023
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <p>
  Therefore, a total of 1023 combinations. However we can
  make this calculation much faster. Notice that for each value
  of \(n\),

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  f(n) &amp;= 2^{n-1} - 1\\
       &amp;= \frac{2^n}{2} - 1\\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <p>
  Also note that from \( x = 2^n \), we can even go one step
  further and find the total combinations function,
  \( m(x) \) so we don't have to deal with converting between
  \(x\) and \(n\):

  $$
  m(x) = \frac{x}{2} - 1
  $$

  <p class='begin'>
  Taking the probability of there being a tile of value 2 or
  4 being emitted into account would at first seem hard,
  but notice that given a tile of value 4, the total moves
  required decreases by 1, because:

  $$
  m(4) = \frac{4}{2} - 1 = 1
  $$

  <p>
  We need to first count the number of tiles which have value
  4 that is required to build each value. From the diagram
  shown before we can see that the number of tiles \(t\)
  required at number \(x\) is given by:

  $$
  t = \frac{x}{4}
  $$

  <p>
  Hence let's define a decay function \(D(x)\) that will
  give the change in combinations, given some value of \(x\).
  So given some probability of 4 being emitted each turn
  \(P\), we can deduce our decay function quite intuitively
  &mdash; given some value \(x\) we know that the total number
  of blocks of value 4 required is given by \(\frac{x}{4}\):

  $$
  D(x) = -\frac{x}{4}P
  $$

  <p>
  The negative 1 results from the fact that we need to subtract
  from \( m(x) \). However we can't ignore the condition that
  there can't be a fraction of a combination; one cannot do
  1.5 combinations. So we need to either:

  <ul>
    <li>Get the ceiling of the value: \(\lceil 1.5 \rceil = 2\).</li>
    <li>Get the floor of the value: \(\lfloor 1.5 \rfloor = 1\).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  We'll opt for the more optimistic approach and <i>assume</i>
  that, given number of tiles \(t\), if \(t \times P &lt; 1\)
  then no tiles of value 4 are generated. Hence we'll go with
  the floored function:

  $$
  D(x) = -\lfloor \frac{x}{4}P \rfloor
  $$
  </p>
  <p>
  Which satisfies our three test cases, given that \( x = 8 \):
  <ul>
    <li>When \(P = 1\), \(D(x) = -2\) and \(m(x) + D(x) = 1\).
        There is only 1 combination needed for tiles of value 4. Also
        if \(x = 4\), \(D(x) = -1\) and thus \(m(x) = 0\).</li>
    <li>When \(P = 0.5 \), \(D(x) = -1\) and \(m(x) + D(x) = 2\).
        Because combining a tile of value 4 and 2 tiles of value 2
        to make 8 only requires 2 combinations.</li>
    <li>When \(P = 0\), \(m(x)\) remains unchanged.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p class='begin'>
  Finally we can write down the completed function
  that takes into account the probability of 2 or 4 being
  emitted each turn. We'll use \(M(x)\) for the sake of keeping
  it simple:

  $$
  M(x) = \frac{x}{2} - 1 - \lfloor \frac{x}{4} P \rfloor
  $$

  <p>
  So it requires less than 1023 <i>combinations</i> to make
  the 2048 tile! But remember our second assumption that the
  player is 100% efficient and <i>does not make any mistakes</i>.
  Interestingly, we can safely say that some values are impossible
  to attain in our lifetime, even given an infinitely large
  board, because the number of combinations required increases
  exponentially in powers of 2.
