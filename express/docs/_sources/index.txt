Welcome to Express's documentation!
===================================

**Express** is a lightweight library for designing web APIs, based on
Flask and Werkzeug for acting as high-level routers. Express is made
because I needed a robust and easy-to-use API for developing web APIs,
and a library full of helpers which prevent me from reinventing the wheel.

Express is a companion to the Synrails library- first you have your TCP
servers, now you have an entire web API. It is not meant as a reaplcement
for other frameworks like Flask, but just a library based on them which
offers some task-specific tools.

A simple "Hello World!" API::

    import express
    app = express()

    @app.serve()
    def serve(request):
        method = request.form["method"].strip()
        return app.Model._run(string=method)

    @app.event("hello")
    def hello_world():
        return "Hello World!"

    app.listen(5000)

Run the script above, and start another Python REPL, preferrably
with the ``requests`` HTTP library installed::

    >>> call = {"method":"hello"}
    >>> requests.post("http://localhost:5000/", data=call).text
    '{"value":"Hello World!","status":"True"}'
