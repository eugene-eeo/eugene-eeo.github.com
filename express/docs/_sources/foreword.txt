Why another framework?
----------------------

Yes, I do know about the various web frameworks out there (there's
one named express for Node.js too, but I didn't know that it existed).
And there are lots of web frameworks- Django, Pylons, Flask, CherryPy,
just to name a few.

No, this is not just another framework- I prefer to call it an engine,
because it does not give you the tools which make up a web framework,
just a API development library which helps you develop Web APIs.

-----------------
What is it, then?
-----------------

It's a library full of helpful functions which I made, and found useful
for most web applications. Though most of them are quite erratic, I must
admit. In short, it's a library to help develop APIs.

In the design of the API, I also realized that making too many assumptions
to what the developer may need is also (extremely) bad as it leads to code
complexities. So I didn't make many assumptions and threw everything into
configuration variables.
