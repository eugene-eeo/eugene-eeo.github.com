  <h1>Introducing minitube</h1>
  <p>
    I use a window manager so I constantly have browser windows that take 1/2
    or 1/4th of my screen. What annoys me is playing youtube videos in a 1/4
    window – the top navbar scrolls as I scroll down so it covers part of the
    video. If I zoom in, the navbar gets larger as well. Full screen isn’t an
    option as well. What we need is a ‘full-page’ video player.
  </p>
  <video controls width='100%'>
    <source src='static/minitube-demo.mp4' type='video/mp4'>
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>

  <p>
    So I made <a href='http://minitube.surge.sh'>minitube.surge.sh</a>.
    (There are probably plugins that do this, but I like writing code.)
    The only selling point of this is that it's really lightweight.
