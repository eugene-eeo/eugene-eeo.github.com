  <h1>Battleship Masks</h1>
  <p>
    A common approach when desiging algorithms that play battleship
    is to have two states: <i>Hunt</i> and <i>Kill</i>. When we are in the <i>Hunt</i> state,
    we want to find a square with part of an unsunk ship as quickly as possible
    and switch to <i>Kill</i> and fire at adjacent squares.
  <p>
    A challenge therefore is to find a good way of hunting. We informally
    state this problem as:

    <blockquote>
      Find a firing pattern such that <i>any ship on the board can be found</i>
      (no matter how ships are placed, at least 1 part of the ship can get
      fired on) and the <i>number of shots fired is a minimum.</i>
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>
    A good start is to overlay a checker-board pattern atop the board, and
    only fire at the black squares. We can do this because even the smallest
    ship (2 squares) will lie on a black and white square, so we need only
    to fire at one of the colours – eventually one shot will find a part of
    some ship.
  </p>

  <p>
    First define an \( l \)-ship as a ship of length \( l \). Consider what
    happens when the 2-ship is sunk. Each ship is now at least length 3, so
    we can use this information and obtain a firing pattern (a <i>mask</i>)
    that has fewer black squares and yet finds all ships.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let the length of the smallest unsunk ship be \( l \). We know this
    length because the opponent tells us when we've sunk a ship. Consider
    a \( l \times l \) square with the diagonal all coloured black (similar
    to the identity matrix of size \( l \)).

  <p>
    <b>Claim:</b> In an \( l \times l \) board, if we overlay the diagonal
    mask on the board and fire at only black squares, we can find an \(l\)-ship
    no matter how it is orientated or positioned.

    <blockquote>
      <b>Proof:</b> Say that the ship is vertical, and it is in column \( j \).
      No matter which column it is in, there is one row \( i = j \) such
      that we have a black square at \((i, j)\). The case for when the ship
      is horizontal is symmetric.

      <p>
      Additionally, any one ship lies on at most one black square. So this mask
      has the minimum number of shots required to find one \(l\)-ship.
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now consider repeating the masks in a 2x2 tiling. We want to show
    that no matter how we place an \(l\)-ship, it will lie on at least one black
    square. Notice that along any column or row, the number of white squares between
    any two black squares is \(l-1\).

  <p>
    Assume that the ship is placed horizontally. (The case when the ship is vertical is
    again symmetric). We need to consider a few cases for the position of the
    “head” of the ship. Let the position of the first black square be \( x \),
    and the distance from the black square to the head of the ship be \( d \).
    Then we need to consider a few cases for \( d \):

    <ul>
      <li>\( d \leq 0 \): the head of the ship is hit.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
        \( 0 &lt; d &lt; l \): columns occupied is in
        [\(x + d\), \(x + d + (l - 1)\)]. We know that the next black square
        is at column \( x + l \). Rearranging expressions in the range, we get [\( x + d \), \( x + l + (d - 1) \)],
        which includes \( x + l \).
      </li>
      <li>\( d \geq l \): the next black square will hit. (This case can only happen
      when the ship is placed along the first row.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter the value for \( d \) or \( x \) the \(l\)-ship lies only
    on one black square, which shows that the number of shots fired will be a minimum.

  <p>
    When tiling this mask repeatedly to cover the whole board,
    we use induction to prove that any \( l \)-ship or larger will lie on one black
    square. For the inductive step assume that the \( n \times n \) tiling is ok
    and consider the \( (n + 1) \times (n + 1) \) tiling.

  <p>
    As the diagram shows we can split the newly added row/column of masks to overlapping
    2x2 masks. Since any \(l\)-ship lies on at most 2 masks, showing that the 2x2 masks
    finds all ships completes the proof. When we tile the original 10x10 board we just
    cut off any excess pieces from the mask:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>

        <figcaption>Same but with the 4-ship diagonal.</figcaption>
      </center>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Larger ships \( \geq l \) may span more than 2 masks at once. In this case we can
    still find all ships because we find any ship of length \( l \) in any 2x2 tiling
    of the mask.

  <p>
    A fun problem to consider is what is the expected number of shots required
    to find and sink a single \( 2 \)-ship on an \(n \times n\) board. We know
    that we need to fire using the checkerboard pattern, so the number of shots
    needed at most is \( n^2 / 2 \). Assuming that the ship is placed on any
    position with equal probability we find that:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  E(X) &amp;= 1 * P(\text{hit}) + 2 P(\text{1 miss}) P(\text{hit}) + 3 P(\text{1 miss}) P(\text{2 miss}) P(\text{hit}) + \ldots \\
       &amp;= \frac{1}{n^2/2} + 2 \times \frac{n^2/2 - 1}{n^2/2} \frac{1}{n^2/2-1} + \ldots \\
       &amp;= \frac{1}{n^2/2}\sum_{i=1}^{n^2/2}{i} = \frac{1}{n^2/2}\frac{n^2/2(n^2/2 + 1)}{2} \\
       &amp;= \frac{n^2/2+1}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <p>
  Once we found a ship we fire at the adjacent squares – on average we need
  \( (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/4 = 2.5 \) shots to sink it. Therefore the expected
  value for the number of shots is:

  $$
  \frac{n^2/2+1}{2} + 2.5
  $$

  <p>
  Generalising the above calculation should be straightforward — but
  finding the precise number of black tiles on the \( n \times n \) board
  when we are finding \( l \)-ships where \( l \neq 2 \) is tricky.
