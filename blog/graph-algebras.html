  <h1>Graph Algebras</h1>

  <p>
    This is a quick and dirty post about some thoughts I had when reading
    <a href="https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/an-algebra-of-graphs/">Graph Algebras</a>
    by Andrey Mokhov. In the post, he describes two operators that can
    be used to decompose any graph into a series of operations on smaller
    subgraphs. An analogy is:

    $$ 5 = 2 + (4 - 1) $$

    here + and - are the operators, and 2, 4, 1 are the subgraphs. The
    two operators are Overlay (\( + \)) and Connect (\( \rightarrow \)):

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    (V_1, E_1) + (V_2, E_2) &amp;= (V_1 \cup V_2, E_1 \cup E_2) \\
    (V_1, E_1) \rightarrow (V_2, E_2) &amp;= (V_1 \cup V_2, E_1 \cup E_2 \cup (V_1 \times V_2)) \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    where \( \times \) denotes the cartesian product of two sets. For simplicity,
    when we have a graph that's just a single node, we would denote it by
    just the node itself, e.g. \( v \equiv (\{v\}, \emptyset) \). We also
    define \( \epsilon \equiv (\emptyset, \emptyset) \).

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> here we will consider only undirected graphs, but in the
    original post and the <a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/alga">implementation</a>
    one can use this algebra for directed graphs.

  <p>
    An example of a graph expressed using Overlay and Connect is the complete
    graph on 4 nodes &mdash; \( K_4 \), (graph with 4 nodes where every node
    is connected to every other node) can be defined in terms of our operators
    using:

    $$
    (1 \rightarrow 2) \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 4)
    $$

  <p>
    Or visually:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><center><img width="60%" src="static/graph-algebras-1-2.png" /></center></td>
      <td><center><img width="60%" src="static/graph-algebras-3-4.png" /></center></td>
      <td><center><img width="60%" src="static/graph-algebras-k4.png" /></center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><center>\(1 \rightarrow 2\)</center></td>
      <td><center>\(3 \rightarrow 4\)</center></td>
      <td><center>\((1 \rightarrow 2) \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 4)\)</center></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    It is easy to see that \( + \) and \( \rightarrow \) can produce any
    graph, starting from the one-vertex graph. To prove this, consider any
    graph \( G = (V, E) \), then the following expression is equivalent to \( G \):

    $$
    \sum_{(u, v) \in E}{(u \rightarrow v)}
    $$

  <p>
    where \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{a_i} \) in this context is abused to mean \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n \).
    Intuitively, we just overlay all of the edges (the individual (\( u \rightarrow v \))s) on top of one another,
    and we get the original graph back. There is a subtle mistake though,
    that the above expression only works on connected graphs (where all
    nodes have at least one neighbour). The fix is easy:

    $$
    (V,E) \equiv (\sum_{(u, v) \in E}{(u \rightarrow v)}) + (\sum_{v \in V}{v})
    $$

  <p>
    But of course, doing a decomposition this way would yield no benefits
    for anyone trying to get a 'feel' for the graph. For instance, we
    could well have expressed \( K_4 \) as:

    $$
    (1 \rightarrow 2) +
    (1 \rightarrow 3) +
    (1 \rightarrow 4) +
    (2 \rightarrow 3) +
    (2 \rightarrow 4) +
    (3 \rightarrow 4)
    $$

  <p>
    Which would be no better than simply listing the edges. One (possibly)
    open question is then the following: can we compute a 'minimal' decomposition
    of any graph \( G \) using the operators? Or better yet &mdash; given some
    decomposition of graph \( G \) using the operators, can we simplify it?

  <p>
    Formalisms aside, the intuitive question is this: <b>can we get a more 'compact'
    decomposition?</b> One way to start approaching this problem is by looking at the
    axioms of the algebra. We have the following properties:

    <ol>
      <li>\( G + G = G + \epsilon = \epsilon + G = G \)</li>
      <li>\( G \rightarrow \epsilon = \epsilon \rightarrow G = G \)</li>
      <li>\( x + y = y + x \)</li>
      <li>\( x \rightarrow y = y \rightarrow x \) for undirected graphs</li>
      <li>\( x \rightarrow (y + z) = (x \rightarrow y) + (y \rightarrow z) \)</li>
      <li>\( x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z = (x \rightarrow y) + (x \rightarrow z) + (y \rightarrow z) \)</li>
    </ol>

  <p>
    Probably with quite some head scratching we can use the axioms to simplify
    our list of edges for \( K_4 \). But a simpler method is to use the following
    extra observation (simply an application of rule 5 and 6):

    $$
    (x \rightarrow (y + z)) + (y \rightarrow z) = x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z
    $$

  <p>
    Rewriting our edge list for \( K_4 \):

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    K_4
    &amp;= (1 \rightarrow (2 + 3 + 4)) + (2 \rightarrow (3 + 4)) + (3 \rightarrow 4) \\
    &amp;= (1 \rightarrow (2 + 3 + 4) + (2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4)) \\
    &amp;= (1 \rightarrow (2 + (3 + 4)) + (2 \rightarrow (3 \rightarrow 4))) \\
    &amp;= 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    Which turns out to be 'simpler' than our original expression! This problem
    probably is NP-hard, but it would be interesting to come up with heuristics
    to simplify decompositions. Any simplification would likely also help speed
    up algorithms which process the graph based on decompositions.


  <h2>Cographs?</h2>

  <p>
    Another interesting direction is the following: consider the two operators
    Disjoint Union (\( \oplus \)) and the Disjoint Join (\( * \)); they should
    immediately ring bells for those who know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cograph">Cographs</a>.
    They are defined very similarly as follows:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    (V_1, E_1) \oplus (V_2, E_2) &amp;= (V_1 \cup V_2, E_1 \cup E_2) \\
    (V_1, E_1) * (V_2, E_2) &amp;= (V_1 \cup V_2, E_1 \cup E_2 \cup (V_1 \times V_2))
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    with one very important difference: \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) (and by extension,
    \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \)) must be disjoint, i.e. \( V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset \).

  <p>
    It has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X81900135?via%3Dihub">shown</a>
    that any graphs constructed using the two operations (starting on the one-vertex
    graph) do not contain \( P_4 \) (the path on 4 vertices) as an induced subgraph
    (i.e. we cannot get \( P_4 \) by deleting vertices and their incident edges).

  <p>
    A question naturally arises: <b>given any forbidden subgraph \( H \), does there
    exist a set of operators such that we cannot get \( H \) as an induced subgraph
    in graphs constructed using those set of operators?</b> We must place some
    restrictions on those operators so that the problem doesn't get too easy;
    they...

    <ul>
      <li>cannot bound the size of the graphs they operate on. Otherwise we
          can just limit the size of the sets to be \( |H| - 1 \).</li>
      <li>are only allowed to perform set operations on the graphs, e.g.
          intersection, union, cartesian product, difference, etc.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Even if the answer to the previous question is &ldquo;not always&rdquo; or the
    problem ends up being ill-defined, it would be interesting to see crazy constructions
    just to prevent say, \( C_3 \).
