  <h1>Birthday Problem</h1>
  <p>
    Given a class of size \(N\), what's the probability
    of <i>two</i> students sharing the same birthday? <a href='http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.birthdayprob.html'>A
      classical statistics problem</a>. The answer to that,
    rather unintuitively is:

    $$
    1 - \frac{365!}{(365 - N)! \times 365^N}
    $$

  <p>
    We can see that the probability of birthday-sharing
    rises very quickly with respect to \(N\). In fact
    you need 23 people to have more than 50% chance of
    sharing a birthday.

  <p>
    There is also such a problem in crypography. When
    expressed formally - given a hash function with a
    finite (and this is crucial) number of outputs \( H \),
    find a message/'image' \(x\), and a different one \(x'\),
    such that<a href='#1'>[1]</a>:

    $$
    \text{hash}(x) = \text{hash}(x')
    $$

  <p>
    We know that the attacker will eventually find \(x\)
    and \(x'\) because hash functions have finite outputs -
    if they produce 128-bits for example then the space
    is just \(2^{128}\); while the sizes of their inputs
    are usually larger than their outputs. For instance
    SHA1 has a block size of 512 bits while it's digest
    (output) is only 160 bits.

  <p>
    The birthday attack exploits the solution to the birthday
    problem- you can see where this is going; if we have
    a finite amount of output \(H\) then the probability
    of finding \(x'\) after \(N\) trials with unique
    inputs is:

    $$
    1 - \frac{H!}{(H - N)! \times H^N}
    $$

  <p>
    This brings out a host of problems- particularly in
    digital signatures. A common example of an 'attack'
    is the following:

    <ul>
      <li>Mallory generates a lot of versions of a fair
          contract \(x\), e.g. by re-wording it, changes
          in punctuation etc, such that it will still
          be acceptable for Bob.</li>
      <li>Mallory also generates a lot of versions of a
          fraudulent contract \(x'\). She then finds the
          version of the fair and unfair contracts that
          have the same hash.</li>
      <li>She gives \(x\) to Bob, who then signs it. She
          then attaches the signature to \(x'\), therefore
          proving that Bob has signed \(x'\).</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    The Birthday Attack is a test on collision resistance
    and second-image resistance (how easy it is to find
    \(x'\), not just through brute forcing but e.g. using
    analysis of the algorithm).

  <p>
    To make such attacks uneconomical<a href='#2'>[2]</a>
    the hash function should choose a large enough \(H\)
    and it is simple to see why &mdash; from our expression
    for the probability, \(H^N\) grows much faster than \(H!\).

    <b>[1]:</b> For the unfamiliar: cryptographic hash
    functions are functions that satisfy the following
    properties (usually referred to as the 'ideal properties'):
    <ul>
      <li>
        Given the hash \(y\), it is hard to find the corresponding
        input \(m\) such that \(\text{hash}(m) = y\), other than by
        trying all values; i.e. it is hard to compute in another
        direction. Other functions that satisfy this are known
        as trapdoor functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is hard/impossible to find a different message
        which has the same hash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Small change in a message should result in a large change
        in the output.
      </li>
      <li>
        It should be fast to evaluate.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b>[2]:</b> Actually there are more ways to do this; one
    way is to make it hard to compute the hash- for example
    by requiring the attacker to take the hash of the hash
    (time-hard) or using a memory-hard algorithm that uses
    up a lot of memory.

  <p>
    Modern algorithms such as <code>scrypt</code>
    or the bleedging edge, <code>argon2</code> have configurable
    \(\tau\) (time) and \(m\) (memory) requirements to make them
    more resistant against improvements from Moore's Law and using
    highly specialised chips. But those are implementation details
    and should largely be avoided in higher level overviews.
