  <h1>Approximating Spheres with Triangles</h1>

  <p>
    This is a homemade solution to a problem that probably already has very
    thoroughly investigated solutions - <i>how do we make a collection of triangles
    look like a sphere?</i> For me, this screams immediately of solving using
    recursion &mdash; if some shape looks like a sphere, then we can make
    it look <i>more</i> like a sphere.

  <p>
    The initial shape that we start off with is the octahedron &mdash; two
    pyramids with their bases glued together, and we scale it so that it fits
    within a unit sphere. This gives us 8 initial triangles to work with.

  <h3>Edge Subdivision</h3>
  <p>
    We recursively generate more triangles from each face as follows.
    Each triangle has 3 midpoints along 3 of it's edges. We call these
    \( m_{01}, m_{02}, m_{12} \). We then <i>lift</i> these midpoints so they
    touch the surface of the sphere &mdash; in other words we normalise
    them. We can then form 4 new triangles from the midpoints and the
    existing vertices. It's easier to see this on a diagram:

  <pre>
       p0                  p0
       /\                  /\
      /  \                /  \
     /    \      =&gt;  m01 /....\ m02
    /      \            / \  / \
   /________\          /___\/___\
  p1          p2      p1    m12  p2</pre>

  <p>
    Because this algorithm subdivides triangles based on the midpoints of
    their edges, we call this <i>edge subdivision</i>. Below we visualise
    the results of running it twice:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      <img src='static/st-edge-1.png' width='100%' align='center'/>
      <figcaption>
        Looks like a huge DnD die.

      <figcaption>
        Starting to look more like a sphere.
      </figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    We can repeat this procedure on the triangles until we run out of
    memory/patience or we reach a certain depth \( d \). This algorithm
    generates \( 8 * 4^d \) triangles at the end. The number of triangles
    generated throughout the lifetime is similarly, \( 8( 4^1 + 4^2 + \ldots + 4^d ) \)
    which fortunately still works out to \( \Theta( 4^d ) \).

  <p>
    Running it with \( d = 4 \) gives something that looks a lot like a sphere,
    as shown below, while running it with \( d = 3 \) gives an aesthetically
    pleasing "chunky" sphere (first diagram on the page).

  <h2>Alternatives</h2>
  <h3>Midpoint Subdivision</h3>
  <p>
    An alternative to edge subdivision is <i>midpoint subdivision</i>. This is a
    variant which lifts only one midpoint on the triangle, and creates two new
    triangles. The tricky thing about this algorithm is how you define the points
    for the new triangles:

  <pre>
       p0                 p0
       .                  .
      / \                /|\
     /   \      =&gt;      / | \
    /     \            /  |  \
   /_______\          /___|___\
  p1          p2      p1  m   p2</pre>

  <p>
    The algorithm should generate two new triangles \( (m, p_0, p_1) \) and \( (m, p_2, p_1) \),
    instead of the more natural \( (p_0, p_1, m) \), \( (p_0, m, p_2) \). In the first
    case, we make sure that the <i>next</i> subdivision would produce a diagonal cut,
    from \( m \) to \( (p_0, p_1) \) and \( (p_2, p_0) \), whereas in the second case
    the algorithm just keeps making cuts from \( p_0 \). A picture paints a thousand words:

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Midpoint subdivision gives us \( \Theta( 2^d ) \) triangles, so we would expect
    to use a higher depth for it to look more spherical. At higher depths we see
    the pattern of spheres drawn by the algorithm - it contains more obtuse and scalene
    (thin and wide) triangles compared to that of edge subdivision, which has more
    equilateral-looking triangles:

    <figcaption>
      Midpoint-subdivision with \( d = 6 \).
    </figcaption>
  </center>

  <p>
    An advantage that it has over edge-subdivision is that the memory consumption
    can be controlled more easily because it grows in a factor of 2 rather than
    a factor of 4.

  <h3>Centroid Subdivision</h3>
  <p>
    Yet another alternative is called <i>centroid subdivision</i>. Here, we lift
    the centroid \( c \) from the triangle, and then make 3 new triangles:

  <pre>
       p0                 p0
       .                  .
      / \                /|\
     /   \      =&gt;      / | \
    /     \            /._c_.\
   /_______\          //_____\\
  p1          p2      p1      p2</pre>
  <figcaption>
    The ASCII art doesn't quite do it justice.
  </figcaption>

  <p>
    This was my original solution to this problem, and as we see it doesn't quite
    work; there are deep grooves in the surface of the sphere that cannot be fixed
    even at higher depths:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      <img src='static/st-centroid-3.png' width='100%' align='center'/>
      <center><figcaption>\( d = 3 \), notice the deep cuts.</figcaption></center>
    </div>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      <img src='static/st-centroid-4.png' width='100%' align='center'/>
      <center><figcaption>\( d = 4 \) still has deep cuts.</figcaption></center>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The lesson learnt here is that the subdivision strategies should avoid producing
    thin triangles. This is because intuitively there is more value in producing
    "fatter", regular triangles. Thin triangles, when subdivided are going to fill
    less of the sphere's surface, and it will be even worse when you subdivide
    thinner and thinner strips.

  <h2>Hybrids</h2>
  <p>
    A couple more nice pictures of running hybrid algorithms - a mix between
    multiple algorithms:

  <div class='row'>
    <p>
      <img src='static/st-hybrid1.png' width='150px' align='left' hspace=10/>

      <h3>Edge-Centroid</h3>
      We switch between edge- and centroid-subdivision as the algorithm
      progresses - i.e. first run edge, then centroid, then edge, ... until
      the depth is 0.
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <p>
      <img src='static/st-hybrid2.png' width='150px' align='left' hspace=10/>

      <h3>Centroid-Edge</h3>
      Similar to Edge-Centroid, but we use centroid-subdivision first.
      Notice how the "bias" in the algorithm has changed completely.
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <p>
      <img src='static/st-hybrid3.png' width='150px' align='left' hspace=10/>

      <h3>Midpoint-Centroid-Edge</h3>
      Probably the most interesting out of all the hybrid algorithms because
      of the shapes produced.

  <h2>Misc</h2>
  <p>
    You can get the code that generates these spheres <a href='static/spheres.py'>here</a>.
    Requires matplotlib. Usage example:

$ python spheres.py edge 3 YlGnBu_r
$ python spheres.py centroid 3 YlGnBu_r
$ python spheres.py midpoint 3 YlGnBu_r
</pre>

  <p>
    The colormap used for the diagrams is <code>YlGnBu_r</code>.
