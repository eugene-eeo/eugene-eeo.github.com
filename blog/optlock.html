  <h1>Optimistic Locking</h1>
  <p>
  The most commonly taught method of ensuring data-integrity during
  concurrent operations is known as pessimistic locking, or placing
  a lock around the entire read and update operation.
  </p>

      </span>

    Although this simple model does guarantee that no other writers can
    modify the data when one is holding the lock, it can lead to abysmal
    (really bad) performance on low-contention systems, where the writes
    and conflicts are infrequent.
  </div>
  <p>
  What we hope to achieve when using optimistic locking is to minimise
  the time that we are within a lock, and by doing so, increasing our
  throughput. Because when we hold a lock, we stop all other threads
  from executing. To do this we need a system that satisfies the
  following assumptions:
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>There are very few conflicts.</b> This is the most important
    factor and if it is not met, often renders optimistic locking a
    slower solution than pessimistic locking.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Data transformations are pure and have no side effects.</b> That
    is, if we are given a transformation function <b><i>T(x) = k</i></b>,
    for the same input <b><i>x</i></b> we <i>always</i> get <b><i>k</i></b>
    regardless of any external changes.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>It is cheap to retry transactions with new versions of data.</b>
    In some systems this may not hold true, especially if it is
    computationally intensive to calculate the next version of the
    data.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>We can determine conflicts between writes easily and relatively
    cheaply.</b> There are a few ways of doing this- via a version
    number which indicates how many times it has been written to,
    or using immutable data structures so checking if something is
    different is just using object identity.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The process of applying all changes or no changes at all is known
  as a transaction. Transactions guarantee (or they <i>should</i>)
  atomicity, which basically means all or nothing- you either get
  all changes or no changes. This helps maintain integrity of our
  data as well.
  </p>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2 m-1'>
      <span class='d-box d-fill'>Read/Copy</span><br/>
      <span class='d-box d-fill'>Transform</span><br/>
      <span class='d-box d-fill'>
        <span><b>Lock</b></span><br/>
        <span class='d-box d-fill'>Check</span>
        <span class='d-box d-fill'>Swap</span>
      </span>
      <figcaption>Fig 2: Optimistic Locking</figcaption>
    </div>

    Note that the transform step mutates/updates the local copied
    version. The check step validates whether the version that was
    copied is outdated. This can be done as previously mentioned via
    comparing the version or the object identity. If the check fails,
    the transaction is aborted and restarted. Else, the changes are
    <i>committed</i>.
  </div>

  <div class='outline'>
  <span class='bigtext'>!</span>
  <b>Important:</b> if we are working with versioned objects,
  remember to bump the version at the end of the compare-and-swap
  operation.
  </div>

  <p>
  Although in simple systems we can just assume that there is only a
  binary option: abort or apply changes, in more complex systems we can
  have more options. Take the VCS tool, Git for example. If we commit
  to a local copy of the shared data (the repository) and someone else
  commits as well, we can either:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Win</b> - our changes are committed and written to the repo.</li>
    <li><b>Lose</b> - we need to "replay" our changes atop the changed
        data structure; essentially, the latest version.</li>
    <li><b>Merge changes</b> - both our changes can be merged if they
        do not modify the same files. Else we would need to resolve the
        conflicts.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Having a side-effect free transformation is also important. For
  example if we had stored all the transformations performed on the
  data and we wanted an arbitrary version, we can just apply the
  transformations to the initial version. A concrete example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>changes = [
    lambda x: x.append(1),
    lambda x: x.append(2)
    ]
data = []
for item in changes:
    item(data)
assert data == [1, 2]</code></pre>
  <p>
  No matter how many times we apply the changes, as long as we start
  from the same initial data we will always get the same final result.
  This is especially useful if, say we wanted to get the older version
  of our code. We wouldn't want that to differ due to some external
  conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's see how a trivial Optimistic Locking implementation would look
  like in Python. First we will need some machinery for the versioned
  objects:
  </p>

  <pre><code>from threading import RLock, Thread

class Versioned:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = (data, 0)
        self.lock = RLock()

    def get(self):
        return self.data

    def commit(self, new_data, copied_version):
        with self.lock:
            if copied_version != self.data[1]:
                raise Exception
            self.data = (new_data, copied_version + 1)</code></pre>

  <p>
  If you look at the <code>Versioned.get</code> method you will
  notice that there is no locking. There needn't be a lock
  because we are guaranteed that when the <code>data</code>
  is modified by the <code>commit</code> method, a lock will
  be held.
  </p>

  <p>
  Then we need the threads to update their copies of the data and
  automatically retry failed transactions:
  </p>

  <pre><code>def task():
    while True:
        try:
            data, version = obj.get()
            obj.commit(data + 1, version)
            break
        except:
            pass

obj = Versioned(0)
threads = [Thread(target=task) for _ in range(10)]
[thr.start() for thr in threads]
[thr.join() for thr in threads]

assert obj.get() == (10, 10)</code></pre>

  <p>
  It won't solve all your concurrency issues, but when you
  get a situation which fits the four assumptions, please
  consider using optimistic locking.
