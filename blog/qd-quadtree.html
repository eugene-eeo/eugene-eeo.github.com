  <h1>Quadtreeified Meshes</h1>
  <p>
    This document is basically a write-up and introduction to a small experiment
    I wrote to test the viability of quadtrees for triangle meshes. If you want
    to skip straight to the graphs and experiment: <a href='#lolscience'>click here</a>.

  <p>
    Given a triangle mesh defined by vertices, we can (on average),
    efficiently find the triangle bounding any given point using a
    quadtree. This techinique is also known as spatial partitioning.

  <p>
    We will first see how to index a mesh using a quadtree. Every
    node in the quadtree will represent the rectangle \( R \) bounding
    \( x_0 \leq x \leq x_1 \) and \( y_0 \leq y \leq y_1 \), and will
    have a depth \( d_n \), starting from 1 (see figure 2). It will have
    the following operations:

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Triangles()</b> return the list of triangles associated with the node.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Add(T)</b> if the given triangle \( T \) is within \( R \),
      or if the \( R \) is within \( T \), or any of the edges of
      \( T \) intersects the edges of the \( R \), associate it with
      the node.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Partition(q, d)</b> if \( |\text{Triangles()}| \gt q \)
      and \( d_n \lt d \), create four child nodes which partition
      \( R \) into 4 equally sized regions (see figure 1), add the triangles
      associated with the current node to each of the four nodes, and then
      partition those nodes again with the same parameters. This can be
      implemented in pseudocode like the following:</p>
      <pre>
def partition(self, q, d):
    if self.depth &lt; d and len(self.triangles()) &gt; q:
        self.children = partition_into_nodes(self.r)
        for n in self.children:
            n.add(self.triangles())
            n.partition(q, d)</pre>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Contains(p)</b> returns true if \( p \) is inside \( R \).</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Query(p)</b> returns the triangle that bounds \( p \). This
        can be done by recursively searching the child that contains \( p \)
        until we have reached a leaf node, and then testing each of the
        triangles associated with that node:</p>
      <pre>
def triangle(self, p):
    if not self.contains(p):
        return
    node = self
    while True:
        <b>if len(node.children) == 0:</b>
            break
        for child in node.children:
            if child.contains(p):
                node = child
                break
    for triangle in node.triangles():
        if triangle.contains(p):
            return triangle</pre>
      <p>
        Of particular interest is the highlighted line, which assumes that
        the value of the variable <code>node</code> has changed from the
        previous iteration, i.e. it is one of the child nodes. Hence the
        code handling the partitioning must be robust against rounding errors.<sup><a href='#1'>[1]</a></sup>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A common question that arises is what happens if the point being queried
    lies on the edge of a triangle or the edge of a node which triangle/node
    should be tested? In that case either triangle can be returned, and we
    cannot assume (nor should we) that the algorithm makes any guarantees about
    which is returned.

  <p>
    The pseudocode for using our algorithm to partition/index-into the
    mesh is straightforward (but in 'real world' implementations we can
    just set the internal list of triangles to the triangles in the mesh,
    as the topmost node must contain all triangles in the mesh).

  <pre>
node = Node(bounding_box(mesh))
for triangle in mesh.triangles:
    node.add(triangle)
node.partition(q, d)
</pre>

  <p>
    I have written a reference implementation in Go that can be found
    <a href='https://github.com/eugene-eeo/qd-quadtree'>on Github</a>. Intuitively
    we can see that the space requirements for such a data structure depends heavily
    on the \( q \) and \( d \) factors involved. For instance a tree with a high
    \( d \) will tend to branch out more if \( q \) is small enough. We also find
    that intuition about the effect of \( d \) and \( q \) on the number of nodes
    required to partition the mesh is correct, as the figure shows (take note that
    the y-axis is logarithmic):

  <figure><img src='static/qd-nodes.png' width='100%'/></figure>

  <p>
    Another factor to consider is the time required to query the triangle bounding
    one point. We can see that it is in the best case, \( O(q) \) but \( O(n) \)
    in the worse case - consider a mesh where all of the \( n \) triangles share
    one common 'origin' vertex. In that case it is possible to end up with one node
    that will contain all of the triangles.

  <p>
    Therefore our quadtree approach is very input sensitive, and performs slightly
    better for different types of meshes. Below is the graph of how the algorithm
    performs when it comes to querying the quadtree, with the y-axis representing
    how many triangles (in total, over all of the queries) are scanned to return the
    result of 2000 random query points.

  <figure><img src='static/qd-scanned.png' width='100%'/></figure>

  <p>
    As we can see from the graphs, a depth of around 8 is optimal (for our
    input pattern) as most values for \( q \) start to converge, and the
    number of nodes used for most values of \( q \) has already 'saturated'.
    If anything, the lesson learnt here is to never use \( q = 1 \) unless
    you know beforehand that the mesh is able to be nicely partitioned.

  <p>
    The mesh was generated by computing the Delaunay Triangulation of 2000
    random points sampled from the normal distribution \( x,y \sim N(0, 2.5^2) \).
    For the random points used to test the quadtree, a uniform distribution
    over the range of the bounding box of the mesh, \( x \sim U[x_{\min}, x_{\max}] \)
    and \( y \sim U[y_{\min}, y_{\max}] \) was used.

      <figcaption><b>Figure 4:</b> mesh generated from uniform distribution \( U[0, 10] \).</figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The normal distribution was chosen to obtain a mesh with a lot of vertices
    in the middle to explore the space requirements when there are lot of triangles
    in one part of the mesh. I also found it to resemble some natural structures,
    for instance flowers: most tend to have a lot of detail in one part of
    the mesh. In the future Poisson Disc Sampling would be a nice thing
    to look into<sup><a href='#2'>[2]</a><a href='#3'>[3]</a></sup>.

  <p>
    The tests can be repeated (with probably minor modifications of the code)
    for different configurations of distributions, but I think the results for
    the number of triangles scanned will largely have the same distribution/pattern,
    if not of the same magnitude.

      <a name='1'></a><b>[1]:</b> one way around this would be to use a second
      variable to store a pointer to the previous node, and then break if said
      variable and the next node are equal:
      <pre>
prev = None
while True:
    if prev == node or len(node.children) == 0:
        break</pre>
