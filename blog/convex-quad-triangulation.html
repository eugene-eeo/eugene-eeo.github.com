  <h1>Guarding Convex Quadrilaterals</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Problem:</b> given a simple polygon \( P \) of \( n \) vertices and a
    set of diagonals that partition \( P \) into convex quadrilaterals, find
    the minimum number of cameras required to guard<sup><a href='#2'>[2]</a></sup> it.

  <p>
    A convex quadrilateral is a 4 sided polygon such that the interior angle
    at any vertex is not more than 180 degrees. Given such a definition, we
    can proceed to make the following claim:

  <blockquote>
    \( n \) must be in the form \( 2t + 4 \), where \( t \geq 0 \).
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It is easy to see why from Figure 1: 4 vertices are required initially to
    create the first convex quadrilateral. Since all vertices must define the
    border of the polygon (from the definition of a vertex), if we want to get
    one more quadrilateral, 2 more vertices need to be added.

      <b>Figure 1:</b> To add one more quadrilateral, two more white vertices
      need to be added. \( t \) is also the minimum number of diagonals required
      to partition \( P \) into convex quadrilaterals.

      just one more vertice as an inner vertex \( v \) will be 'obsoleted'.

  <p>
    To find the minimum number of cameras required we can do a four colouring
    of the graph according to the quadrilaterals<sup><a href='#1'>[1]</a></sup>.
    We will first prove that choosing the the colour which has the minimum number
    of nodes, the <i>minimum color</i> from such a coloring is sufficient to guard
    \( P \). Trivially, we can guard a convex quadrilateral with only one camera,
    so the minimum color is suitable for guarding it.

  <p>
    <img src='static/t1.png' align='left' width='30%' />

    Consider the addition of a successive quadrilateral \( Q \), which
    must be defined by two existing and two new vertices. Because the two
    existing vertices are already colored, then the remaining new vertices
    must be colored differently.

  <p>
    It follows that one of the shared vertices now has the minimum colour,
    because the number of nodes with the other two colours has increased.
    This is an important result which will be used in the next step.

  <p>
    <img src='static/t1-diagonal.png' align='left' width='30%' />

    Let \( v \) be a vertex with a minimum color that is shared by both
    \( Q \) and \( P \). From the definition of a convex quadrilateral,
    both of its diagonals must lie inside \( Q \), so the line segment
    from \( v \) to any of the new vertices of \( Q \) must also lie
    inside \( Q \).

  <p>
    To prove the claim for any \( n \), we assume that it the minimum
    color is sufficient to guard a quadrilateral \( P \). As we have shown
    above, adding another quadrilateral \( Q \) and coloring it also makes
    it guard-able by the minimum color. Hence we have shown by induction
    that the minimum colour from four colouring the vertices is sufficient
    to guard such a polygon \( P \).

  <p>
    The upper bound for the number of nodes with the minimum color in a four
    colouring is, intuitively, the floor of the number of vertices divided by 4
    (because the residue discarded by flooring is taken up by one or more of
    the other colors):

    $$
    \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor = \lfloor 1 + \frac{t}{2} \rfloor = 1 + \lfloor \frac{t}{2} \rfloor
    $$

  <p>
    Another way to approach the same solution is to consider the worse case
    scenario where the successive quadrilaterals keep being added to one side
    of the existing polygon. We have shown that we can guard two quadrilaterals
    by placing a camera in a shared vertice, hence we can guard \( t + 1 \) such
    quadrilaterals with at most:

    $$
    \lceil \frac{t+1}{2} \rceil
    $$

  <p>
    cameras. (Ceiling is used to correct for \( t = 0 \) and even numbered values.)
    This is equivalent to \( \lfloor n/4 \rfloor \), and can be verified by
    analysing cases when \( t \) is an even or odd number, i.e. by plugging in
    \( t = 2q \) or \( t = 2q+1 \).

  <p>
    Thus the upper bound on the number of cameras required to guard \( P \)
    is given by \( \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \). This does not contradict the
    Art Gallery Theorem's upper bound of \( \lfloor n / 3 \rfloor \) because
    we have not exceeded the upper bound.

    <p>
      <a name='1'></a><b>[1]:</b> This just means that the nodes that make up
      any quadrilateral do not have the same colors. For instance, you cannot
      have a quadrilateral that is made of red, red, blue, and green nodes.

    <p>
       <a name='2'></a><b>[2]:</b> A set of points \( S \) is said to guard a
       polygon \( P \) iff for every point \( p \) in the polygon, there exists
       a point \( q \) from \( S \) such that \( \overline{pq} \) is within \( P \).
