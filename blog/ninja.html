  <h1>Ninja: N-Dice Sums</h1>
  <p>
    The following article describes how to derive a (recursive)
    probability distribution for the sum of rolling N-dice (the
    fruit ninja slices and dices) with very rudimentary probability
    and statistics knowledge.
  <p>
    We are all familiar with the distribution for a fair, 6-sided die:
  <center>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>\(x\)</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>\(P(x)\)</th>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
      <td>\(\frac{1}{6}\)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  <p>
    What about that of a two dice? Those of you familiar with
    combinations will immediately jump to a solution. However
    we'll be using a more simplistic approach. Let \(X\) be the
    sum of the faces of the two dice, and \(P_2\) the probability
    function for the sum. Then what we want to find is:

    $$
    P_2(X=x) = \sum{P(i) \times P(j)}
    $$

  <p>
    subject to \(i + j = x\), and \(i, j \in \{1,2,3 \ldots 6\}\).
    We can then use this definition to find the probability distribution.
    So to calculate the distribution for 2 dice:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    P_2(2) &amp;= P(1)P(1) = \frac{1}{36} \\
    P_2(3) &amp;= P(1)P(2) + P(2)P(1) = \frac{2}{36} \\
    P_2(4) &amp;= P(1)P(3) + P(2)P(2) + P(3)P(1) = \frac{3}{36} \\
           &amp;\ldots
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    Simple enough. Now let's generalise our formula and say
    that, for \(N\) dice rolls the probability distribution over
    the set of outputs \(X\), we can write:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P_N(X=x) &amp;= \sum{P_{N-1}(i) \times P_1(j)} \\
   \text{where } &amp;\, i + j = x, \\
     \text{and } &amp;\, j \in \{1,2,3, \ldots 6\}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    Which is the same as saying that the probability of the
    sum being \(x\) is the sum of the probability of the
    previous \(N-1\) dice rolls being \(i\) times (and) the probability
    of the N<sup>th</sup> dice roll being \(j\), where \(i + j = x\).
    We'll now simplify the expression by noting that for any value
    of \(j\), \(P_1(j) = \frac{1}{6}\).

    $$
    P_N(X=x) = \frac{1}{6}\sum^u_{i=l}{P_{N-1}(i)}
    $$

  <div class='outline'>
    <span class='bigtext'>?</span>
    <b>Note:</b> I picked this recursive form because it frees
    us from having to think about the combination of values
    required. For example if we want to build the value 4 from
    3 dice rolls, we don't have to think about the combinations,
    i.e. {1,1,2}, {1,2,1}, {2,1,1}.
  </div>

  <p>
    All that's left to do now is to find the upper and
    lower bounds, \(u\) and \(l\) respectively, for the sum.
    Now see that \(1 \leq j \leq 6\) needs to be satisfied
    because \(P_1\) only has non-zero values for 1 to 6.
    From \(i + j = x\):

    $$
    1 \leq x - i \leq 6
    $$

  <p>
    After some rearranging and solving for \(i\), we arrive
    at the following pair of inequalities:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    i &amp;\geq x - 6 \\
    i &amp;\leq x - 1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    At the same time, we know that \(u\) cannot be larger
    than \(6(N-1)\) because it is the maximum value of \(x\) for
    the previous distribution. Also, \(l\) cannot be smaller
    than \(N - 1\), the smallest value for the previous
    distribution. So we have, combining with our previous
    inequalities:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    l &amp;= \max(N - 1, x - 6) \\
    u &amp;= \min(x - 1, 6(N - 1))
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    Which is the same as saying that:
    <ul>
      <li>
        We start from \(N - 1\) when it is possible to
        add a value \(j\) from 1 to 6 (inclusive) such that
        \(i + j = x\).
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is not possible, then we will have to start
        from \(x - 6\) since \(x - 6\) is now greater than
        the lowest value of the previous distribution.
      </li>
      <li>
        End at \(x - 1\) when we can add 1 to the last value
        of \(i\) such that \(i + 1 = x\), and when it is
        smaller than the maxmimum value of the previous
        distribution.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Putting it all together we have:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
       P_1(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{6} \\
     P_N(X=x) &amp;= \frac{1}{6}\sum_{i=l}^{u}{P_{N-1}(i)} \\
\text{where }\, l &amp;= \max(N - 1, x - 6), \\
                u &amp;= \min(x - 1, 6(N - 1))
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <h2>Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    Ninja is the name for a project on Github modelling the
    probability distribution of the sum of N-dice. You can
    find it at <a href='https://github.com/eugene-eeo/ninja'>eugene-eeo/ninja</a>,
    and run the simulations yourself. The distributions are
    simulated using the same technique as highlighted above,
    namely:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P_N(X=x) &amp;= \sum{P_{N-1}(i) \times P_1(j)} \\
   \text{where } &amp;\, i + j = x, \\
     \text{and } &amp;\, j \in \{1,2,3, \ldots 6\}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
    The core of the simulation algorithm is:

  <pre>
from collections import defaultdict
from fractions import Fraction


def dice_sum(prev_dist=None):
    p = Fraction(1, 6) # 1/6
    if prev_dist is None:
        return {n: p for n in range(1, 6+1)}

    dist = defaultdict(Fraction)
    for i in prev_dist:
        for j in range(1, 6+1):
            dist[i+j] += prev_dist[i] * p
    return dist</pre>

  <p>
    It is generational and only requires the previous
    distribution to calculate the next. As such the distribution
    for the N<sup>th</sup> roll can be calculated fairly quickly
    in roughly <b>O(N)</b> time.

  <p>
    Because we are using arbitrary precision arithmetic in
    the form of fractions and bignums in Python we can also
    store and compare the values exactly. You can find the
    results from both the <a href='/ninja/results.html'>simulation</a>
    and <a href='/ninja/results2.html'>computation</a>.
