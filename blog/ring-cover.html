  <h1>Ring Cover</h1>
  <p>
    Say we place 5 items in a circle. If we count in 1s, i.e. the
    1st item, then the 2nd, then the 3rd then we will count all
    items by the end of 5 counts. What if instead we counted by 2?
    This is now a bit trickier. Let's call the first item the 0th
    item. Then our count sequence would be like this:

    $$
    0, 2, 4, 1, 3
    $$

  <p>
    So we still <i>cover</i> the ring of all 5 items. Notice that
    because we're counting in a ring we could ignore all items that
    are above 5; so these two count sequences are in some sense,
    the same:

    <center>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>0</b></td>
        <td><b>2</b></td>
        <td><b>4</b></td>
        <td>5 + <b>1</b></td>
        <td>5 + <b>3</b></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>

  <p>
    This idea is cleanly encoded in the modulus operator:
    \( 8 \equiv 3 \pmod 5 \) and in general, \(p \equiv r \pmod q\)
    iff \( p = aq + r \) \( \forall a \in \mathbb{Z} \).

  <p>
    Now comes the general question: given \( n \) objects in a ring,
    can we cover the ring if we count by \( a \) each time? Let
    \( F(n, a) \) denote whether we can cover the ring of \( n \)
    objects counting by \( a \).

  <center>
  <img src="static/ring-cover.png" width="40%"/>
  <figcaption>Ring with \( n = 5 \), \( a = 2 \).</figcaption>
  </center>

  <p>
    Let's get some obvious cases out of the way:

    <ul>
      <li>\( a = 0 \) never covers any \( n \). I don't really want to prove this.</li>
      <li>\( a = 1 \) always covers any \( n \).</li>
      <li>If \( n \) is a multiple of \( a \), i.e. \( a \mid n \) then \( a \) doesn't cover \( n \).</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Now we ask the following: if we count using a prime number,
    do we cover all values of \( n \), assuming that \( a \) does
    not divide \( n \)? Well this <i>should</i> be true; it does
    hold for simple examples like \( n = 5, a = 2,3 \).

  <blockquote>
    <b>Claim:</b> if \( a \) is a prime and \( a \nmid n \) then \( a \) covers \( n \).<br/>
    <b>Proof:</b> Consider the count sequence (all taken mod \( n \)):

        $$
        0, a, 2a, 3a, \ldots (n-1)a
        $$

      <p>
        Our claim of coverage is equivalent to saying that there are no two elements that repeat
        themselves in this sequence. Now assume the contrary; that this sequence does contain
        some duplicate. So we say there <i>is</i> some \( i \neq j \), \( ia \equiv ja \pmod n \),
        and that both \( ia \) and \( ja \) are \( \leq (n-1)a \). If that's the case we can
        rewrite them as:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        ia &amp;\equiv pn + r \\
        ja &amp;\equiv qn + r
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        Now assume, that \( i \lt j \). It follows that \( p \lt q \). This is the same as
        saying that for some \( b \gt 0 \), \( q = p + b \):

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        ja &amp;\equiv (p + b)n + r \\
           &amp;\equiv pn + bn + r \\
           &amp;\equiv ia + bn \geq ia + n
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        So \( ja \) is not in the (finite) count sequence! Thus we have a contradiction, and we
        find that the prime \( a \) <i>does</i> indeed cover \( n \) but only if \( a \) is
        not a multiple of \( n \).
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    We then can ease our lives with this observation - if say \( n = 5 \)
    and \( a = 4 \), then our count sequence is:

    $$
    0, 4, 3, 2, 1
    $$

    But this is the same as the count sequence for 1: \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \)
    but reversed around 0. Intuitively this makes sense - since we're adding
    in a ring of \( n \) elements it shouldn't matter if we count from \( n - b \)
    or \( b \). Let's prove it:

    <blockquote>
      <b>Claim: \( F(n, a) = F(n, n - a) \)</b><br/>
      <b>Proof:</b> Consider the count sequences for \( a \) and \( n - a \):

      <p>
      <center>
      <table>
        <tr><td>\( 0 \)</td><td>\( 0 \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( a \)</td><td>\( (n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( 2a \)</td><td>\( 2(n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( 3a \)</td><td>\( 3(n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( \vdots \)</td><td>\( \vdots \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( (n-1)a \)</td><td>\( (n-1)(n-a) \)</td></tr>
      </table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Now let's try expanding some of the brackets; expanding the last one on the
      right count sequence gives us:

      $$
      n^2 - an - n + a \equiv a \pmod n
      $$

      This is eerily similar to the second element in the left count sequence.
      Let's try to show that the two sequences are in fact the same, but just
      reversed around 0. What happens if we take the \( (i+1) \)-th element from
      the right sequence?

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      (n-i)(n-a) &amp;= n^2 - an - in + ia \\
                 &amp;= n(n - a - i) + ia \\
                 &amp;= ia \pmod n
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      And so we have a one-to-one mapping between the two sequences; if one covers
      \( n \) then the second one covers \( n \) as well. \( \Box \)
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    The previous result is a special case of the more general result
    as follows: for any \( b \),

    $$
    F(n, a) = F(n, bn + a)
    $$

    this is easily proven using a similar approach.

  <p>
    Now what happens if our number is neither a prime nor a divisor of \( n \)?
    For instance, we know that for \( n = 16 \), we can't cover it with 2 but we
    can cover it with 3. Can we hope to cover it with 6? Intuitively again the
    answer is no; we never touch any odd numbered objects.

  <p>
    So for any such \( a \), we must have that \( a \) is a composite number (not a prime).
    We can rewrite \( a \) as \( pq \). Then we claim that for \( 1 \lt p,q \lt a \):

    <blockquote>
      <b>Claim:</b> \( F(n, pq) = F(n, p) \land F(n, q) \)<br/>
      <b>Proof:</b> Let's consider the infinite count sequences for both numbers.

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      0, p, 2p, \ldots, (q-1)p, qp, \ldots, 2qp, \ldots \\
      0, q, 2q, \ldots, (p-1)q, pq, \ldots, 2pq, \ldots
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      <p>
        From the table we can see that eventually there are common elements
        \( qp \) and \( pq \), \( 2qp \) and \( 2pq \) and so on; in other
        words we are interested in the <i>intersection</i> of these two count
        sequences.

      <p>
        Now, if any one of the count sequences of \( p \) or \( q \) <i>does not</i>
        cover \( n \) then we are done; the intersection with any other sequence
        will not result in another sequence covering \( n \). If they both cover
        \( n \) then their intersection, the count sequence for \( pq \) <i>also</i>
        covers \( n \). \( \Box \)
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    So with all these in mind we can finally give a "nice" expression
    for \( F(n,a) \):

    $$
    F(n,a) = \begin{cases}
       false &amp;\text{if } a = 0 \\
       true  &amp;\text{if } a = 1 \\
       false &amp;\text{if } a \mid n \\
       true  &amp;\text{if } a \text{ is prime} \\
       F(n,r)   &amp;\text{if } a = mn + r \land m \gt 0 \\
       F(n,p) \land F(n,q) &amp;\text{otherwise} \\
                           &amp;\text{where } a = pq \land p,q \lt a
    \end{cases}
    $$

    The last case is actually equivalent to taking the prime number decomposition
    of \( a \) and then checking if \( F(n, p) \) holds for each of the primes \( p \).
    If you're programming this function you can also add the following case
    to avoid having to decompose \( a \):

    <blockquote>
      If \( a \gt n/2 \) then \( F(n,a) = F(n,n-a) \).
    </blockquote>

    This follows directly from one of our previous results. Some applications
    I can imagine for this is to produce a "good enough" shuffle of a list
    (say a list of songs) without actually shuffling the list; we can pick
    a suitable value for \( a \) and then just count in steps of \( a \).
