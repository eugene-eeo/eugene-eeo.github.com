  <h1>Ring Cover</h1>
  <p>
    Say we place 5 items in a circle. If we count in 1s, i.e. the
    1st item, then the 2nd, then the 3rd then we will count all
    items by the end of 5 counts. What if instead we counted by 2?
    This is now a bit trickier. Let's call the first item the 0th
    item. Then our count sequence would be like this:

    $$
    0, 2, 4, 1, 3
    $$

  <p>
    So we still <i>cover</i> the ring of all 5 items. Notice that
    because we're counting in a ring we could ignore all items that
    are above 5; so these two count sequences are in some sense,
    the same:

    <center>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>0</b></td>
        <td><b>2</b></td>
        <td><b>4</b></td>
        <td>5 + <b>1</b></td>
        <td>5 + <b>3</b></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>

  <p>
    This idea is cleanly encoded in the modulus operator:
    \( 8 \equiv 3 \pmod 5 \) and in general, \(p \equiv q \pmod n\)
    iff \( \exists a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \) s.t. \( p = an + r \) and
    \( q = bn + r \).

  <figcaption>Ring with \( n = 5 \), \( a = 2 \).</figcaption>
  </center>

  <p>
    Now comes the general question: given \( n \) objects in a ring,
    can we cover the ring if we count by \( a \) each time? Let
    \( F(n, a) \) denote whether we can cover the ring of \( n \)
    objects counting by \( a \).

  <p>
    Let's get some obvious cases out of the way:

    <ul>
      <li>\( n = 0 \) is covered by any \( a \).</li>
      <li>\( a = 0 \) never covers any \( n \).</li>
      <li>\( a = 1 \) always covers any \( n \).</li>
      <li>If \( n \) is a multiple of \( a \), i.e. \( a \mid n \) then \( a \) doesn't cover \( n \).</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Just to warm up, we start off with this observation - if say \( n = 5 \)
    and \( a = 4 \), then our count sequence is:

    $$
    0, 4, 3, 2, 1
    $$

    But this is the same as the count sequence for 1 (\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \)),
    only reversed around 0. Intuitively this makes sense - we're adding in
    a ring of \( n \) elements so it shouldn't matter if we count from
    \( n - a \) or \( a \). Let's prove it:

    <blockquote>
      <b>Claim: \( F(n, a) = F(n, n - a) \)</b><br/>
      <b>Proof:</b> Consider the count sequences for \( a \) and \( n - a \):

      <p>
      <center>
      <table>
        <tr><td>\( 0 \)</td><td>\( 0 \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( a \)</td><td>\( (n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( 2a \)</td><td>\( 2(n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( 3a \)</td><td>\( 3(n-a) \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( \vdots \)</td><td>\( \vdots \)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>\( (n-1)a \)</td><td>\( (n-1)(n-a) \)</td></tr>
      </table>
      </center>

      <p>
      Now let's try expanding some of the brackets; expanding the last one on the
      right count sequence gives us:

      $$
      n^2 - an - n + a \equiv a \pmod n
      $$

      This is eerily similar to the second element in the left count sequence.
      Let's try to show that the two sequences are in fact the same, but just
      reversed around 0. What happens if we take the \( (i+1) \)-th element from
      the right sequence?

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      (n-i)(n-a) &amp;= n^2 - an - in + ia \\
                 &amp;= n(n - a - i) + ia \\
                 &amp;= ia \pmod n
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      And so we have a one-to-one mapping between the two sequences; if one covers
      \( n \) then the second one covers \( n \) as well. \( \Box \)
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    The previous result is a special case of the more general result
    as follows: for any \( b \),

    $$
    F(n, a) = F(n, bn + a)
    $$

    this is easily proven using a similar approach. This means counting with \(a\)
    is the same as counting with the remainder of \( a \) mod \( n \), which eases
    our lives.

  <p>
    Now what happens if our is not a divisor of \( n \)?
    Let's focus on one case first - composite numbers.
    For instance, we know that for \( n = 16 \), we can't cover it with 2 but we
    can cover it with 3. Can we hope to cover it with 6? If we write out the count
    sequence, the answer is no, because we never touch any odd numbered objects.

  <p>
    Since \( a \) is a composite number we can rewrite it as \( a = pq \),
    with suitable values for \( p, q \) - notably, \( 1 \lt p, q \lt a \).

    <blockquote>
      <b>Claim:</b> \( F(n, pq) = F(n, p) \land F(n, q) \)<br/>
      <b>Proof:</b> Let's consider the infinite count sequences for both numbers.

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      0, p, 2p, \ldots, qp, \ldots, 2qp, \ldots \\
      0, q, 2q, \ldots, pq, \ldots, 2pq, \ldots
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      <p>
        From the table we can see that eventually there are common elements
        \( qp \) and \( pq \), \( 2qp \) and \( 2pq \) and so on; in other
        words the count sequence of \( pq \) is given by the <i>intersection</i>
        of these two count sequences.

      <p>
        Now, if any one of the count sequences of \( p \) or \( q \) <i>does not</i>
        cover \( n \) then we are done; the intersection with any other sequence
        will not result in another sequence covering \( n \). If they both cover
        \( n \) then their intersection, the count sequence for \( pq \) <i>also</i>
        covers \( n \). \( \Box \)
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    So we know that if \( a \) does cover \( n \), then the divisors of
    \( a \) also need to cover \( n \). If we follow this recursive argument,
    then we are eventually left with prime numbers. E.g.:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    F(n, 84) &amp;= F(n, 2) \land F(n, 42) \\
             &amp;= F(n, 2) \land F(n, 2) \land F(n, 21) \\
             &amp;\ldots \\
             &amp;= F(n, 2) \land F(n, 2) \land F(n, 3) \land F(n, 7)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Now, we know that if any (prime) number divides \( n \) then we can't
    hope to cover \( n \) with said number. This implies that in order for
    \( a \) to cover \( n \), \( a \) needs to share no common divisors with
    \( n \), i.e. \( a \) and \( n \) need to be <i>coprime</i>. Otherwise,
    eventually when we break down \( a \), we would find some \( p \) to be
    a multiple of \( n \).

  <blockquote>
    <b>Claim:</b> if \( a \) and \( n \) are coprime then \( a \) covers \( n \).<br/>
    <b>Proof:</b> Consider \( a \)'s count sequence (all taken mod \( n \)):

      $$
      0, a, 2a, 3a, \ldots (n-1)a
      $$

    <p>
      Our claim of coverage is equivalent to saying that there are no two elements that repeat
      themselves in this sequence.

    <p>
      Now assume the contrary: this sequence contains some duplicate elements \( ja \equiv ia \pmod n \),
      s.t. \( i \neq j \) and both \( 0 \leq i \lt j \leq n-1 \). We can rewrite them as:

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      ia &amp;= pn + r \\
      ja &amp;= qn + r
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      We can rearrange these around \( r \) and set them to be equal to each other:

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      ia - pn &amp;= ja - qn \\
      ja - ia &amp;= qn - pn \\
      a(j - i) &amp;= n(q - p)
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      Since \( j \gt i \) (and it follows that \( q \gt p \)), we can rewrite \( j \) and \( q \)
      in terms of \( i \) and \( p \):

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
      j &amp;= i + c \\
      p &amp;= q + d
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      For some \( c,d \gt 0 \). Then we substitute back into our equation:

      $$
      ac = nd
      $$

      Now we know that \( a \) and \( n \) are coprime. So we can't get rid
      of common multiples on both sides. Thus, any satisfying assignment to
      this equation has the form \( c = fn \) and \( d = fa \) for some
      \( f \in \mathbb{Z} \).

    <p>
      Since \( c \gt 0 \), it follows that \( f \gt 0 \) and now a chain
      of statements follows:

      $$
      j = i + c = i + fn \gt i + n \gt n - 1
      $$

      we've found our contradiction! Thus we find that the prime \( a \)
      <i>does</i> indeed cover \( n \) if \( a \) is not a multiple of \( n \). \( \Box \)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    So with all these we can finally give an expression for \( F(n,a) \):

    $$
    F(n,a) = \begin{cases}
      true  &amp;\text{if } n = 0, \\
      true  &amp;\text{if } \gcd(n,a) = 1 \text{ and } a \neq 0, \\
      false &amp;\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

  <p>
    We have, in the end, a nice result with well-known, fast algorithms to compute an
    answer. The correctness of the final expression is pretty easy to show; if we pick
    an \( a \) which is not coprime to \( n \) then using the decomposition argument
    we eventually find a prime that divides \( n \).

  <h3>Cycle Lengths</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Adapting the previous proof we can show the cycle lengths.
    Let \( g = \gcd(n, a) \). Then:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      ac &amp;= nd \\
    gca' &amp;= gdn' \\
     ca' &amp;= dn'
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Remembering that \( c = j - i \), we see that we get cycles of length
    \( c = pn' \lt n \) for a maximal \( p \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \), where
    \( n' = n / \gcd(n, a) \).

    <p>
    Example: \( n = 16, a = 6 \):<br/>
    We expect \( c = \frac{16p}{\gcd(16, 6)} = 8p \lt 16 \).
    This means \( p = 1 \).

    $$
    0, 6, 12, 2, 8, 14, 4, 10, 0, 6, \ldots
    $$

    The cycle length (position of second 0 - position of first 0) is 8.
