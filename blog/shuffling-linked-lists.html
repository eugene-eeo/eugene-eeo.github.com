  <h1>Shuffling Linked Lists</h1>
  <p>
    The algorithm for shuffling an array is well known. It can be done in
    \( O(n) \) time because an array offers random access in \( O(1) \).

  <pre>
shuffle(xs):
  for i = 1 up to n:
      j = random int [1, i]
      xs[i], xs[j] = xs[j], xs[i]
</pre>

  <p>
    However shuffling a Linked List is not that straightforward. Depending
    on what we are allowed, e.g. space or time we can do either of the
    following:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
No space constraints:
<pre>
shuffle-notime(l):
  copy contents of l to array xs
  shuffle(xs)
  curr = l.head
  for x in xs:
      curr.data = x
      curr = curr.next
</pre>
    </div>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
No time constraints:
<pre>
shuffle-nospace(l):
  curr = l.head
  for i = 1 up to n:
      j = random int [1, i]
      find j-th element in l
      curr = curr.next
</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
  Both of these are not ideal - the first one runs in \( \Theta(n) \) time
  but uses the same amount of space. The second one uses constant space,
  but takes \( \Theta(n^2) \) time. Let's try to do better than the second
  algorithm. We want to shuffle the linked list in less than \( \Theta(n^2) \)
  time, and also use constant space.

  <p>
  Consider the following algorithm, QuickShuffle:

  <pre>
quickshuffle(l, n):
  if n == 1: return l
  partition l into 2 equally sized chunks, L, R.
  quickshuffle(L, n/2)
  quickshuffle(R, n/2)
  if random() &lt; 0.5:
      return L o R
  else:
      return R o L
</pre>

  <p>
  Where <code>X o Y</code> means concatenating chunk <code>X</code> with
  chunk <code>Y</code>. When we partition the linked list into two chunks,
  it is similar to slicing an array in Go - a chunk is just a head and tail
  node. That way, we can join them back in \( O(1) \) time.

  <p>
  A diagram of how this runs:

  <pre>
 ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │
 └───┴───┴───┴───┘
   └─┬─┘   └──┬┘      split
┌───┬───┐  ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │  │ 3 │ 4 │
└───┴───┘  └───┴───┘
  │   │      │   │    split
┌───┐┌───┐ ┌───┐┌───┐
│ 1 ││ 2 │ │ 3 ││ 4 │
└───┘└───┘ └───┘└───┘
  └─┬──┘     └─┬──┘   collect and shuffle
┌───┬───┐  ┌───┬───┐
│ 2 │ 1 │  │ 3 │ 4 │
└───┴───┘  └───┴───┘
    └────┬─────┘      collect and shuffle
 ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
 │ 3 │ 4 │ 2 │ 1 │
 └───┴───┴───┴───┘
</pre>

  <p>
  There is a nice property with <code>QuickShuffle</code>. Pick any
  element \( x \), and the probability that \( x \) will be in any position
  \( i \) can be calculated as follows. Let's say \( i \geq n / 2 \). Then
  the probability of \( x \) being in the right chunk is \( 1/2 \). Again
  suppose that \( n / 2 \leq i \leq 3n/4 \). The probability of \( x \)
  being in that chunk is \( 1/2^2 \). This goes on for \( \log_2{n} \) steps
  until we have \( 1 / 2^{\log_2{n}} = 1 / n \).

  <p>
  So we have that property, which is nice. Now the only problem remaining is
  if an element is with another element in a size-2 chunk (e.g. 1,2 and 3,4),
  then it will <i>always</i> be next to that element even after the shuffling
  has completed. This means that some permutations, e.g. [3,1,4,2] are impossible.

  <p>
  Picking a larger number of partitions wouldn't help here - in general if we
  pick a partition size of \( k \) then we would have the same problems but
  just in a size-\( k \) chunk.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>Side note:</i> we can avoid this problem if we interleave the linked
      list with dummy nodes (i.e. place a dummy node next to every real node).
      However this takes \( \Theta(n) \) space and we might as well just use
      the <code>shuffle-notime</code> algorithm.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  To try to counteract this problem we can consider another shuffling algorithm.
  Let's call this Interleave:

  <pre>
interleave(L, R):
  l_p = L.head
  r_p = R.head
  p = L.head.prev
  while r_p != R.tail and l_p != L.tail:
      if random() &lt; 0.5: p.next = r_p; r_p = r_p.next
      else:              p.next = l_p; l_p = l_p.next
      p = p.next
  merge remainders of L or R into p</pre>

  <p>
  For doubly linked lists, the code can be adapted to take into account the
  <code>prev</code> pointer. What <code>interleave</code> does is the following:
  given 2 chunks L and R, we randomly pick a node from L or R and then put that
  in the result, until either chunk is empty.

<pre>
           ┌───┬───┐  ┌───┬───┐
Interleave(│ 1 │ 2 │, │ 3 │ 4 │)
           └───┴───┘  └───┴───┘
                    |
            ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
            │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │ 2 │
            └───┴───┴───┴───┘
</pre>

  <p>
  There are two fundamental problems with this algorithm. For instance, we know
  that 2 can <i>never</i> be in position 1, and the same for 4. So it is not a
  true shuffle. Also we can see that the output is biased towards simply
  rearranging the chunks. For an input of [a,b], [c,d] the probabilities are:

  <center>
  <table>
    <tr><td><code>[a,b,c,d]</code></td><td>\( 1/4 \)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>[a,c,b,d]</code></td><td>\( 1/8 \)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>[a,c,d,b]</code></td><td>\( 1/8 \)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>[c,d,a,b]</code></td><td>\( 1/4 \)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>[c,a,d,b]</code></td><td>\( 1/8 \)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>[c,a,b,d]</code></td><td>\( 1/8 \)</td></tr>
  </table>
  </center>

  <p>
  In general if we have two chunks of size \( k \) then the algorithm is more
  biased towards just rearranging the two chunks (since rearranging chunks is
  done with probability \( 2 * 1/2^k = 1/2^{k-1} \)), while interleaving \( i \)
  elements is done with probability \( {k \choose i} 1/2^{k+i} \lt 1/2^k \).

  <p>
  So we know that 50% of the time we are just rearranging the two chunks, the
  other 50% we actually do (some) interleaving. This is true for larger chunk
  sizes as well. With that in mind, let's combine the two algorithms:

  <pre>
quickshuffle2(l, n):
  if n == 1: return l
  partition l into 2 equally sized chunks, L, R.
  quickshuffle(L, n/2)
  quickshuffle(R, n/2)
  interleave(L, R)
</pre>

  <p>
  For the base case, <code>interleave</code> works fine because there is a
  50% chance of selecting the left chunk and 50% the right chunk. However
  for larger sizes (even a list of length 4), the algorithm breaks down and
  we don't get a perfect shuffle because of the bias in <code>interleave</code>.
