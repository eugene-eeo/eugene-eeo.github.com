  <h1>Recursion to Iteration</h1>
  <p>
  In most languages without the niceties of tail-call
  optimisation, elegant recursive solutions often degrade
  quickly into solutions which take up extensive amounts
  of memory; we know creating a new stack frame for each
  function call is expensive. A typical application for
  recursive functions is the depth-first&nbsp;search:
  </p>
  <pre>
def search_graph(graph, name):
    for node in graph:
        if node.name == name:
            yield node
        nodes = search_graph(node.children, name)
        for item in nodes:
            yield node</pre>
  <p>
  There&#8217;s a way around this that will need us to rethink
  the <i>fundamental</i> way which we approach problems.
  Using a LIFO stack we can refactor our recursive solutions
  into iterative&nbsp;ones:
  </p>
  <pre>
def search_graph(graph, name):
    stack = list(graph)
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node.name == name:
            yield node
        stack.extend(node.children)</pre>
  <p>
  The way the iterative method works is quite&nbsp;unorthodox:
  </p>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      We create a list of nodes from a <i>graph</i>, which
      is an iterable of nodes (this is important in order to
      support generators).
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box'>N1</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N2</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N3</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      Pop a node from the stack, and yield it if it
      matches our criteria.
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box'>N1</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N2</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
    We also extend the stack with the children of the
    node. This is because we want to make sure that
    the next popped node is a node that is a child of
    the current node. Then steps 1 to 3 are repeated
    indefinitely until the stack is exhausted.
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box'>N1</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N2</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N3.1</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N3.2</span>
      <span class='d-box'>N3.3</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
  To implement breadth-first search version of our
  graph-searching algorithm, our approach is a little
  different. Instead of using a LIFO stack we must use
  a FIFO&nbsp;queue:
  </p>

  <pre>
from collections import deque

def breadth_first(graph, name):
    queue = deque(graph)
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node.name == name:
            yield node
        queue.extend(node.children)</pre>

  <p>
  Notice that the semantics and behaviour have changed
  differently just from a few lines of code change. The
  visualisation of a FIFO queue is an excercise left to
  the reader. Note that in this case, using a double-ended
  queue (<code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">deque</a></code>)
  is more efficient since we&#8217;re shifting elements from the
  &#8220;head&#8221; of the array rather than the&nbsp;end.
  </p>

  <p>
  When there are cyclic references which often blow up
  recursive programs, the recommended approach (from experience)
  is to use a <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a></code>
  of &#8220;seen&#8221; elements if your data-structures are&nbsp;hashable.
