  <h1>NFA complement</h1>
  <p>
    The normal way to take the complement of a regular language L, assuming you
    have a DFA recognising L is the following:

    <blockquote>
      Take all accept states and change them into non-accepting states, and
      vice versa.
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    But you cannot do the same for NFAs:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      <figure>
        <img src='static/nfa.png'/>
        <figcaption>M which recognises at least {a, b}.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      <figure>
        <img src='static/nfa-compl.png'/>
        <figcaption>Complement of M which also recognises at least {a}.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    So for correctness you cannot just make non-accepting states accepting
    and vice versa; you probably need to convert it into an equivalent DFA
    first and run the complement algorithm on that.
