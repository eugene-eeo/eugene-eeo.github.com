  <h1>Tree Traversal Space Requirements</h1>
  <p>
    <a href='#summary'>TLDR</a>
  <p>
    Tree traversal (or search) comes in two forms, depth first or breadth
    first. Here is an informal derivation of the space required to traverse
    trees iteratively using FIFO queues or LIFO stacks. We will end up with
    two formulas we can use to quite accurately predict how much space is required.

    <figcaption>Depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS).</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <a name='assumptions'></a><h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p>
    To make things simpler we will only consider "perfect" trees with
    depth \( D \) and each node having exactly \( \mu \) children if they
    are not leaf nodes. Only nodes at the final depth/layer are leaf nodes.
    It is better explained with an example:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width='80%' src='static/tree.svg'/>
    <figcaption>A "perfect" tree with \(\mu = 2 \) and \(D = 3\).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    After examining the tree long enough we can convince ourselves quite
    surely that for a tree with \( n \) nodes can be expressed as a sum 
    of the number of nodes at each depth:

    $$
    n = \sum_{d=1}^{D}{\mu^{d-1}}
    $$

  <p>
    <b>UPDATE:</b> Also we will assume that nodes only have references to their
    children. This is a very general assumption and as such it serves as a good
    benchmark for comparing the improvements gained from other algorithms/tree
    layouts. For instance the example tree shown above would be implemented in
    C with something like this:

  <pre>typedef struct node node;
struct node {
    node *left;
    node *right;
}</pre>

  <h2>Breadth first</h2>
  <p>
    If we were to visit the nodes breadth first using a FIFO
    queue, (which the recursive form can also be reduced to), we can easily
    see that we need to at most store the number of nodes corresponding to
    the bottom-most layer, \( \mu^{D-1} \), i.e. the number of leaf nodes.
    So we need to expand the sum to find it in terms of \( n \):

    $$ n = \frac{\mu^D - 1}{\mu - 1} $$
    $$ \mu^{D-1} = n \Big( 1 - \frac{1}{\mu} \Big) + \frac{1}{\mu} $$

  <p>
    Once you look at the asympotic complexity you end up with \( O(n) \) which
    makes it look really horrible but it is what it is.

  <h2>Depth first</h2>
  <p>
    Deriving the space requirements for depth first traversal using a
    LIFO stack is a bit more involved. First we consider the tree obtained
    from \( \mu = 3 \) and \( D = 4 \), truncated for clarity:
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    If we follow the stack size during the execution of a depth-first
    traversal, we see something like the following:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      It is initialised with only the root node. <b>We are now
      ready to traverse depth 1.</b>
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box'>1:1</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      Root is popped off and then it's children are pushed onto the
      stack. Here we'll assume that the last child is pushed first.
      <b>We are now ready to traverse depth 2.</b>
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      Doing the same thing again, <b>we are now ready to traverse depth 3.</b>
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>3:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>
      Do it again and we'll eventually end up with the following
      stack <b>right before</b> we traverse the leaf nodes (<b>depth 4</b>):
    </div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>3:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>4:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>4:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>4:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The green boxes show the nodes that are about to be traversed, in chunks
    of \( \mu \) and the red boxes show the waiting nodes in chunks of \( \mu - 1 \).
    We can now spot a pattern and see that the space required, right before we
    need to traverse nodes of <b>d<sup>th</sup></b> depth is given by:

  $$
  \text{space}(d) = (\mu - 1)(d - 2) + \mu
  $$

  <p>
    Let's evaluate it and see that it holds for the stack shown above:

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>$$ \text{space}(1) = 1 $$</div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box'>1:1</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>$$ \text{space}(2) = \mu $$</div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>$$ \text{space}(3) = (\mu - 1) + \mu $$</div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>3:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-1-2'>$$ \text{space}(4) = 2(\mu - 1) + \mu $$</div>
    <div class='d-bound col-1-2'>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>2:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>2:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu-1'>
        <span class='d-box'>3:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>3:2</span>
      </span>
      <span class='d-box d-mu'>
        <span class='d-box'>4:3</span>
        <span class='d-box'>4:2</span>
        <span class='d-box'>4:1</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now just evaluate \( \text{space}(D) \) and expand the terms to obtain a
    generalised expression for the maximum storage required:

    $$ D(\mu - 1) - \mu + 2 $$

  <p>
    Again we need play with the terms to obtain something in terms of \( n \).
    From the previous equations used in the breadth first traversal:

    $$ n = \frac{\mu^D - 1}{\mu - 1} $$
    $$ D = \log_{\mu}{(n(\mu - 1) + 1)} $$
    $$
    \text{space}(D) = (\mu - 1)\log_{\mu}{(n(\mu - 1) + 1)} - \mu + 2
    $$

  <p>
    Now to remove the constant terms and put it in asympotic form:

    $$
    O(\log{n})
    $$

  <p>
    Which arguably looks much better than what it actually is. Also note
    that it is interesting to see that if we have a \( \mu = 2 \), the
    space requirements are exactly

    $$
    \log_{2}{(n + 1)} = D
    $$

  <h2>Justification</h2>
  <p>
    To show (rather inelegantly) that the above algorithms and formulas work,
    you can run the following Python program to prove that the formulas are
    correct up to certain values, unless you'd want to wait infinitely long:

  <pre>from collections import deque, namedtuple


Node = namedtuple('Node', ['children'])


def depth_first(node):
    proc = [node]
    while proc:
        yield len(proc)
        node = proc.pop()
        proc.extend(node.children)


def breadth_first(node):
    proc = deque([node])
    while proc:
        yield len(proc)
        node = proc.popleft()
        proc.extend(node.children)


def generate_tree(mu, d):
    root = Node([])
    prev = [root]
    for _ in range(d - 1):
        current = []
        for parent in prev:
            for _ in range(mu):
                child = Node([])
                parent.children.append(child)
                current.append(child)
        prev = current
    return root


def predict_breadth(mu, d):
    return mu ** (d - 1)


def predict_depth(mu, d):
    return d*(mu - 1) - mu + 2


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for mu in range(2, 5):
        for d in range(1, 6):
            t = generate_tree(mu, d)
            depth = max(depth_first(t))
            breadth = max(breadth_first(t))
            print(
                (mu, d),
                depth == predict_depth(mu, d),
                breadth == predict_breadth(mu, d),
            )</pre>

  <p>
    You should get the following output when executed:

  <pre>$ python t.py
(2, 1) True True
(2, 2) True True
(2, 3) True True
(2, 4) True True
(2, 5) True True
(3, 1) True True
(3, 2) True True
(3, 3) True True
(3, 4) True True
(3, 5) True True
(4, 1) True True
(4, 2) True True
(4, 3) True True
(4, 4) True True
(4, 5) True True</pre>

  <a name='summary'></a><h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The space requirements for a breadth first traversal of a <a href='#assumptions'>"perfect" tree</a>
    with number of children (branching factor) \( \mu \) and depth \( D \)
    is given by:

    $$ \mu^{D-1} \approx O(n) $$

  <p>
    And the same for depth first:

    $$ D(\mu - 1) - \mu + 2 \approx O(\log{n}) $$

  <p>
    These look really horrendous when you plug in values because it's the
    space required to traverse the whole tree. For searching (DFS or BFS) less
    than the whole tree would usually need to be traversed.

  <p>
    <b>These are probably of no practical purpose.</b> However one rather odd
    thing we can do (once we have devised a way to optimally find values of
    \( \mu \) and \( D \) for "imperfect" trees) is to accurately pre-allocate
    just enough space for traversal in order to avoid the stacks/queues being
    resized while the traversal is in progress, which may be something that the
    real-time folks might be interested in.

  <p>
    Again, these expressions are only for a tree with very general assumptions.
    Different representations will allow for traversals with different space and
    time properties, and as pointed out in the <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/56fyjw/space_requirements_for_tree_traversal/'>discussion on reddit</a>,
    there are some representations where a search may not require any extra space at all.

  <p>
    <b>A digression:</b> with \( \mu = 1 \) we've essentially made our tree
    into a list. It's reassuring to see that the formulas work for this case
    as well, as both algorithms are now the same and consume the same space, 1.
