  <h1>Hyperbox Explained</h1>
  <p>
    The prisoner problem is conceptually simple. You have 100 boxes which
    all look the same, each with a ticket (and a number between 1 and 100)
    inside. We can represent a simpler version with only 4 boxes on a
    diagram as something like this:
  </p>

  <img src="graph.svg" alt="graph"/>

  <p>
    For the previous example, we can also write it as a mapping like the
    following, from box IDs (a fancy way of identifying the individual
    boxes) to ticket numbers:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>id</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ticket</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    Let's get to the meat of the problem: notice we can open box 0,
    and open the box corresponding to the ticket number, and repeat
    the previous step until we end up at box 0. That is a cycle.
    The length of that cycle is 3 because we needed to look at 2
    other boxes, 2 and 1 to end up at our first box.

  <p>
    Take a moment to digest the previous information. What we want
    to find is, if we randomly shuffle the boxes, what's the
    probability distribution of the longest cycle?

  <p>
    To solve it computationally we need to write down an algorithm
    that will allow us to find the cycles. Below is one that comes
    to mind and is hopefully simple to understand. It takes an
    initial box ID and graph as input.

  <ol>
    <li>Let the given box ID be <b>b</b> and let <b>t = b</b>.</li>
    <li>Let <b>C</b> be a list of cycles, initially set to <b>[b]</b>.</li>
    <li>Let the ticket number corresponding to box <b>t</b> be <b>n</b>.</li>
    <li>If <b>n = b</b>, stop and return <b>C</b>.</li>
    <li>Add <b>n</b> to the end of <b>C</b>.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 4, but set <b>t = n</b>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    We'll call the previous algorithm <b>A<sub>0</sub></b>. Here is the
    same thing, but in Python. The graph is simply a dictionary of box-IDs
    to ticket numbers:

<pre>def nodes_in_cycle(boxes, box_id):
    t = box_id
    nodes = [box_id]
    while True:
        n = boxes[t]
        if n == box_id:
            break
        nodes.append(n)
        t = n
    return nodes

nodes_in_cycle({0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3}, 0)
# =&gt; [0, 2, 1]</pre>

  <p>
    That's great and all, but what we really want is to find all
    the cycles in the graph. Below is an algorithm in words to do
    that:

  <ol>
    <li>Set <b>C*</b> to be an initially empty list of all cycles.</li>
    <li>Let <b>S</b> be the set of all boxes.</li>
    <li>Execute <b>A<sub>0</sub></b> once on the graph with a box from <b>S</b>. Store this result in <b>L</b>.</li>
    <li>Put <b>L</b> to the end of <b>C*</b>.</li>
    <li>For each node <b>n</b> in <b>L</b>, remove it from <b>S</b>.</li>
    <li>If <b>S</b> is not empty, repeat step 3.</li>
    <li>Return <b>C*</b>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Notice something nice about our algorithm - it does not search
    through boxes that have already been opened, so regardless of
    the topology (the way the nodes are connected), our algorithm
    will complete in almost constant time. And below is the algorithm
    in Python:

  <pre>
def all_cycles(boxes):
    S = set(boxes.keys())
    C = []
    while len(S) != 0:
        b = min(S)
        L = nodes_in_cycle(boxes, b)
        C.append(L)
        for n in L:
            S.remove(n)
    return C

all_cycles({0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3})
# =&gt; [[0, 2, 1], [3]]
</pre>

  <p>
    Now that we've got our cycle finding algorithms, all we need is
    some graphs! Fortunately these are easy to generate. Let's walk
    through how we would go about generating one, but for a set of
    N boxes instead of just 100.

  <ol>
    <li>Let <b>B</b> a list of boxes with IDs from [0,N).</li>
    <li>Let <b>R</b> be a list of numbers from [0,N).</li>
    <li>Shuffle <b>R</b>.</li>
    <li>For each <b>i</b>th number in <b>R</b>, let that be the ticket
        number of the <b>i</b>th box.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Quirk in step 1: we could also generate numbers from 1 to 100
    inclusive, but it's easier to count from 0 since we're going to
    code it anyways. In Python we would write the following:

  <pre>
import random

def arrange(n):
    u = list(range(n))
    random.shuffle(u)
    d = {}
    for i in range(n):
        d[i] = u[i]
    return d

arrange(5)
# =&gt; {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 2}
</pre>

  <p>
    In the example arrangement of 5 nodes we generated (you may get different
    results from me), it looks rather unimpressively like the following:
  </p>

  <img src="graph2.svg" alt="graph2"/>

  <p>
    So now time to plug it all together:
  </p>

  <pre>
def simulate(reps):
    results = []
    for _ in range(reps):
        boxes = arrange(100)
        cycles = all_cycles(boxes)
        maxlen = max(len(c) for c in cycles)
        results.append(maxlen)
    return results
</pre>

  <p>
    The idea is that you can just run the simulation function with a
    big number (somewhere around 100 to 1000 if you don't want to
    wait for results), and then plot a histogram of the results.

  <p>
    With that in mind you are now ready to read the more cryptic version of
    the code <a href='https://gist.github.com/eugene-eeo/4df740ed685f0c9689f98ad1ae417a96'>here</a>.
    There are two versions, a Python version which I test against and a Go
    version which is absurdly fast (around 330K simulations per second on
    a quad core 2.4GHz i5). The Go version uses tricks like:

  <div class='indent'>
    <p>
      <b>Using an array instead of a dictionary to represent the graph.</b>
      This is also one advantage of 0 based counting. This arises naturally
      from the constraint that boxes only have one ticket number. So we
      actually just need to shuffle an array from [0,99], and let the
      elements in the array be the ticket numbers, and the indexes be the
      box IDs.

      <table>
        <tr><th>index</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>...</td><td>99</td></tr>
        <tr><th>number</th><td>r0</td><td>r1</td><td>r2</td><td>...</td><td>r99</td></tr>
      </table>

    <p>
      <b>Only one allocation of the graph.</b> The 100-element array is only
      allocated once and we shuffle that array after each cycle-finding
      run (execution of the equivalent <code>all_cycles</code> function
      on the graph).

    <p>
      <b>Using all 4 cores on your PC to do 4 runs at once.</b> This is
      done using threads. But the nice thing is that the simulation code
      does not 'know' (nor does it need to) that it is running in parallel,
      i.e. more than one instance is running at the same time.

    <p>
      <b>Some other low level memory details.</b> The most obvious one is
      using an array, which sped up the program by around 15%, from ~289K
      simulations per second to ~335K per second, because in a fixed-size
      array we don't have to pay the price for unnecessary resizing as well
      as running the key through a hash function on each lookup.

    <p>
      <b>Packing the results (integers) into bytes.</b> The values of
      each run of our experiment is strictly restricted from [1,100].
      One byte is 8 bits, which has a maximum value of <b>2<sup>8</sup> - 1</b>
      (255). This reduced the result-file sizes by around 64%. Also a
      side effect is that we sped up the program a little as we don't
      have to convert a binary representation to base 10.

    <p>
      <b>Using buffered IO.</b> Surprisingly once the other non IO optimisations
      were in place, writing to the output file took up a lot of time, because
      we performed a write to the file for each result we had. A simple analogy;
      imagine another person talking to you, and the speaker wants to relay his
      message to another person 10 meters away. Unbuffered IO is running to the
      other person and telling him each word you hear. But at the same time you
      have to stop the speaker from talking so you don't miss out on any words.

    <p>
      A more sensible approach would be to have a piece of paper (equivalent to
      the computer's memory), and then note down every word you hear until the
      paper is full. Then you tell the person to stop talking, and run to the
      other person 10 meters away and pass her that piece of paper, take a new
      peice of paper and then start listening.
  </div>
  <p>
    As with all code, do not worry too much about the optimisation tricks
    until you really need them. Make it correct, then make it fast. Also it
    is nice to see how other factors affect performance as well - not just
    the choice of algorithm.
  <p>
    Just for laughs you can see how good the simulation does for a larger
    and larger number of runs/iterations:
