    <h1>The Simplicity Paradox</h1>
    <a href="index.html">&#x2190; Back to Index</a>
    <hr/>
    <div class="announce">
        <a name="disclaimer"></a>
        <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
        <p>I am not trying to pinpoint at any framework or project,
        but rather our "nature of coding" in general.</p>
        <p>This article isn't trying to plead you to stop writing code
        or libraries- writing them and improving is part of programming,
        but rather as another random article on the internet.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        So I began developing and using different libraries in Python
        and Perl (thought I do not publish the latter), and I've began
        to realize something: the libraries that declare themselves to
        be simple and minimal <b>are eventually bloated.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Say I built a web framework- I'll name it Workman. I develop it
        over the course of a few months, adding features and cleaning up
        the code. I make a nice site, publish it, and get a large userbase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, so everybody's happy with the code, especially how minimal
        it is and how simple everything is- with little features and the
        literal meaning of micro hard-coded into it's design. Over the
        following months, I publish more releases, fixing bugs and adding
        features every time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that a library is <i>never</i> "good enough", the future
        releases of Workman will keep adding more and more features,
        and there will come, at some point in time, where I cannot call
        it a "micro" framework anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, does this mean that developed libraries can <i>never truly be
        "simple"</i>, as they claim to be? Every now and then a new library
        pops up, replaces another (usually more complex) one. It claims to
        be simple- and the developers add more and more features until one
        day the library becomes too heavy for practical use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cycle of development continues- a simple framework becomes bloated
        and cluttered with unnecessary features, and another one pops up to
        replace it. The said successor framework will then become bloated once
        more, like it's predecessor, and then will be replaced by another one.
        And the cycle is an infinite loop.
    </p>

    <h3>Should we stop writing code?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes and no. No, because competition and improvement is a <b>major</b>
        part of programming. Yes, because sometimes when you are developing
        a new library, do not try and replace whatever you can- doing so
        clutters your code. Rather, focus on your library's speciality and
        develop from there.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not need 50 web frameworks which all offer caching services-
        <a href="http://memcached.org">memcached</a> and <a href="http://redis.io">redis</a>
        are tools which provide that service. We do not need frameworks which
        all replace another framework or tool at doing something. We do not
        need libraries which aim to do everything, because in the end they will
        do <b>nothing</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="announce">
        <a name="good-examples"></a>
        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>
            While most Ruby frameworks try to wrap around <a href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a>,
            their backbone webserver interface (with varying results), some do not.
            Most Python web frameworks also try to replace everything they find-
            some do it well, some don't.
        </p>
        <p>Some good examples like <a href="http://scorchedrb.com/">Scorched</a>
           and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> are ideal frameworks,
           which do not aim to replace their underlying library- but serve as
           a high-level layer in which others can quickly build upon.
       </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Another thing is to avoid using too much "magic", or magical
        functions which do things in the background. These things tend
        to clog up the developer's API without him knowing anything
        about it. As the Scorched documentation puts it: "No magicians
        welcomed".
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Stop trying to replace everything you can since that's feature
        bloat and if you're developing on Python, you're violating the
        Zen of Python PEP. Stop trying to do everything since there is
        another tool for it- that's part of the Unix philosophy to use
        simple tools to solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you've finished reading this article you can go ahead
        and try to replace another library or start your own trend. Best
        of luck for any ideas that you want to push into reality.
