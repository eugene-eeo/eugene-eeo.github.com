<h2>Explaining Static Electricity</h2>

	Static Electricity refers to the "imbalance of electric charges within or on the surface of the material" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity">Wikipedia</a>], which, in everyday life, is normally caused by friction between two different materials- usually insulators. Before we delve deep into the depths of electrostatics, we must first dissect the building blocks of everyday life- the relationship between the nucleus of an atom and the electron.
<p>

	There is a small, but relatively powerful force holding the protons and neutrons together- so strong that to separate them we would require huge particle collider (this is extremely ironic- a huge, 100-tonne machine to separate something smaller than a speck of dust, <i>haha!</i>) and huge amounts of electricity. The force, however powerful it is, only has an "efficient range" of a very small distance- and thus the electrons are not stuck to it, but is rather "leaping around" it (in a seemingly random process known as a quantum leap). The force, known as the nuclear force, would hold protons and neutrons together- and the bigger the number of subatomic particles, the weaker and more unstable the force; thus we could conclude that elements like Uranium are highly unstable, and their electrons are at a huge distance apart from the nucleus.

	Static electricity, on the other hand, involves the displacement, or stealing of the electrons from the atoms of one material to the other. When a material has <i>more</i> electrons, it is negatively charged. When a material has <i>less</i> electrons, it is positively charged. Since opposites attract, any charged material of any type can attract a neutral or oppositely charged material- similar to how a plastic ruler can attract neutrally charged paper, or how a balloon rubbed against furry material would "stick to the wall". Static electricity in everyday life, as expressed in the first paragraph, is usually caused by friction, when a material "steals" the electrons from one material to itself.
<p>
	This is simply because electrons can be exchanged between materials on contact- materials with weakly bound electrons tend to lose them, while materials with sparsely filled outer shells tend to gain them- though such an analysis would require more complex instruments and a more technical knowledge of the atoms that make up the material. This is known as the Triboelectric Effect, and results in an object being negatively charged an another being positively charged.
<p>
	This would work best with an insulator coming into contact with another insulator, because as conductors are essentially materials which allow electrons to flow through them, thus resulting in the conductor being neutrally charged, and the insulator being positively charged. Insulators are materials which hold their electrons very tightly, and thus are good at containing or holding the charge. When two different conductors come into contact with one another, and friction is produced as a result, nothing would happen as they would just balance the charge because electrons can move freely between the materials themselves, and electrons would simply move around.
<p>
	Objects do not have to be rubbed to gain different charges- they just need to be in contact with each other, and rubbing just increases the surface area of those two objects coming into contact. You should also be aware of the <b>Conservation of Charge</b> law, which states that neither electrons or protons are gained, but they are just moved from one atom to the other, similar in nature to the Conservation of Energy. The force of the electric charges depend on the distance of the two different charges- as illustrated in <b>Coulomb's Law</b>, which is basically
	<p>
		<center><i>F = k<sup>e</sup> * [(q<sub>1</sub> * q<sub>2</sub>) / d<sup>2</sup>]</i></center>
	<p>
	This (distance is inversely proportional with the intensity) can be effectively expressed with the Inverse Square Law, <i>i = 1/d<sup>2</sup></i> in which the intensity of a given energy would decrease inversely when the distance is increased.

	<h3>Footnotes</h3>
	This document would assume that the reader has appropriate knowledge of the atom itself, at least at an elementary or basic level, and therefore I would skip explaining parts of an atom but show the relationship between a subatomic particle to another. If you are unsure of what is within an atom, please look at the picture provided with this link: [<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Atom_diagram.png">Wikipedia</a>].
